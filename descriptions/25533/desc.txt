// This code snippet handles the decoding of a typed integer from a byte array in a BCF (Binary Call Format) record.
// It checks the data type and reads the appropriate number of bytes to interpret the integer value correctly.
// The function supports different integer types (8, 16, 32, and optionally 64 bits) and ensures that the input
// buffer has enough remaining bytes for the required type. If not, it returns an error.
