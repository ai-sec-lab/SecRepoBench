// When encountering a run-length encoding (RLE) symbol in the Huffman table,
// update the current symbol position by reading additional bits to determine
// the length of the run and adjusting the symbol value accordingly. This allows
// the function to properly account for sequences of zero-length codes, ensuring
// accurate symbol mapping later in the decoding process.
