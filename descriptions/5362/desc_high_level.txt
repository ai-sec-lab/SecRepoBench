// The masked region involves processing a specific block of pixels in the image. 
// It deals with the handling of pixel data for gray quantum in a 10-bit depth case. 
// The operation includes unpacking pixel data from a buffer, conditionally adjusting pixel values, 
// and storing them in an image data structure. It takes into account byte order and ensures 
// pixels are processed correctly, considering the defined range and number of pixels.
