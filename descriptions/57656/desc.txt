// This block checks for the existence of a file at the given path,
// returning true if the file exists and false otherwise. For Windows
// systems, it uses the _wstat64 function to perform the check with 
// wide-character support. For non-Windows systems, it either attempts
// to open the file in "read-binary" mode to verify existence or uses 
// the stat function to check for a regular file. The appropriate method 
// is selected based on the system to ensure compatibility.
