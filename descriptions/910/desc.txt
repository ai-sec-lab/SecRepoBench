// This function reads a specific tag from an ICC profile. It searches for the tag in the profile's
// directory. If the tag has already been read and stored in memory, it returns the stored pointer.
// Otherwise, it locates the tag in the file, reads its data, and stores it in memory.
// The function validates the tag type, ensuring it is supported and consistent with the expected structure.
// If there are any errors during reading or validation, it returns NULL.
// It handles synchronization using a mutex to ensure thread safety when accessing or modifying the profile data.
