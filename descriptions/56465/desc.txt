// Parse and construct a list of attributes for a given DIE. The function iterates
// through the DIE's abbreviation list to extract each attribute's code and form.
// It allocates memory for each attribute, sets its properties, and appends it to
// a linked list. Indirect forms are resolved, and error handling ensures the DIE's
// data pointer does not exceed the section bounds. If no attributes are found, it
// returns DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY. Otherwise, it allocates a contiguous block of memory to
// store the attributes, and the attribute list and count are returned through the 
// given pointers. On failure, previously allocated attributes are deallocated.
