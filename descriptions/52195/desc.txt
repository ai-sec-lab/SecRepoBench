// Check for simplified triple letter condition in compound words.
// If `simplifiedtriple` is enabled, the code attempts to handle words with triple letters.
// When `striple` is set, it indicates that a potential triple letter condition was detected.
// The `i--` statement ensures that the current position is re-evaluated to check the previous letter.
// The condition checks if the two preceding characters are the same, marking `striple` as true if so.
// This logic helps correctly interpret words like "Schiffahrt" by ensuring "fahrt" is considered correctly.
