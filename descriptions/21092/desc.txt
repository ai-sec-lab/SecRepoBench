// Determine the position of the input value in relation to the 'fromCoord' values
// in the arrayZ structure. If the value is less than or equal to the first
// 'fromCoord', adjust the value by mapping it using the first 'fromCoord' and
// 'toCoord' pair. Otherwise, iterate through the arrayZ structure to find the
// appropriate segment where the value fits, and return a mapped result based
// on that segment's 'fromCoord' and 'toCoord' values. The loop identifies the
// appropriate segment by comparing the input value with the 'fromCoord' values
// of the segments in sequence.
