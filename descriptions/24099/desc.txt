// Extract a character from the tvbuff starting at the given position
// and increment the index variable. Break the loop if the character is
// a semicolon, carriage return, or newline, as these delimit items.
// Ensure that the array does not overflow by checking the index.
// If the upperbound of the index is reached,
// update the next_offset and len, then return FALSE to indicate failure.
// If not, copy the character to the provided string array and decrement
// the remaining max length.
