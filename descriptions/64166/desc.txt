// Function to write the output LUT for Color Rendering Dictionary (CRD).
// Creates a transform from Lab to the given profile's color space and
// uses a pipeline to define the rendering table.
// The transform uses a device link profile to perform the conversion.
// For absolute colorimetric intent, the encoding is made relative to preserve precision.
// Black Point Compensation (BPC) and white point fixup options are considered based on flags.
// The function outputs the rendering intent and constructs the rendering table
// using the first stage of the pipeline, ensuring compatibility with the color space.
// If successful, the CRD is registered as a resource in the PostScript output.
