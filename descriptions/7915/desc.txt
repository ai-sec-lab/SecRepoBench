// Check if the primitive type is one of the specific unsupported types,
// returning NULL if so. Then, determine the number of primitives by iterating
// over the input array until an undefined primitive is found. Allocate memory
// for the path information structure based on the number of primitives, and
// return NULL if the memory allocation fails. This setup prepares for the
// conversion of the primitive information to path information.
