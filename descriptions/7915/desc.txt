// Convert a PrimitiveInfo structure into a vector path structure (PathInfo).
// The function processes each primitive in the provided shape_info array
// and generates corresponding path information. It handles different
// primitive types and ensures proper conversion by checking and removing
// duplicate points, marking open paths, and adding ghostlines as necessary.
// The resulting path_info structure is returned, which represents the
// vector path in a structured format suitable for further processing or
// rendering. If the primitive type is unsupported or no valid path can be
// constructed, the function returns NULL.
