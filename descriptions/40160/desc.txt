// The following part processes TLS cipher suites from a client hello message.
// It extracts cipher suite IDs from the payload and skips GREASE values based on a specific condition.
// The cipher suites are added to a JA3 fingerprinting array if the number does not exceed a predefined maximum.
// After processing the cipher suites, it attempts to identify the client browser by counting specific
// cipher suite IDs that are commonly used by Safari and Chrome browsers. This information is used to set
// heuristic flags for browser identification.
