// Iterate through the cipher suites in the client hello message, skipping
// GREASE values, and populate the JA3 client fingerprint structure with
// the non-GREASE cipher IDs. Increment counters for Safari and Chrome
// specific cipher suites to aid in browser heuristic determination.
// Update the flow's browser heuristics based on the cipher suites detected,
// setting flags for Safari and Chrome browsers. Log the cipher suite
// information for debugging if enabled.
