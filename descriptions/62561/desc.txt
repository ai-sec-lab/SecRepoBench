// Handle the current DXF entity by duplicating its name for internal use.
// If this is not the first object, ensure the previous object has a valid handle.
// If the previous object's handle is missing, generate a new one.
// Allocate a new object in the drawing structure using the entity's name.
// If object creation fails, clean up and return an error.
// For successfully created objects, determine the entity mode (model or paper space)
// based on the owner handle and update the entity mode accordingly.
// Register the entity with its corresponding BLOCK_HEADER if applicable.
// Post-process handles for additional updates and resolve any remaining alias names.
