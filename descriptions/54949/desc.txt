// Attempt to parse the data as a 'strings' dictionary when encountering an '=' character
// after parsing. This involves clearing the previously allocated plist, resetting the
// context position, and using a function to parse and fill a new dictionary structure.
// If parsing fails, clean up and set an error status; otherwise, assign the newly
// created dictionary to the plist.
