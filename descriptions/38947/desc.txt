// Initialize the IO system and attempt to open the specified LWS file.
// If the file cannot be opened, throw an error to indicate failure.
// If opened successfully, read the contents into a memory buffer.
// Parse the file structure from the buffer using the LWS::Element class.
// Initialize a BatchLoader for potentially recursive file imports.
// Set up a list to store node descriptors, representing the scene's graph structure.
// Check the file's magic identifier to verify it's a LightWave scene file.
// Retrieve the file format version, logging it for reference.
// Iterate over the parsed elements to extract and handle various LWS keywords.
// Manage animation frames, object layers, and node properties such as lights and cameras.
// Resolve node parenting relationships to form a coherent scene graph.
// Load additional files as needed using the BatchLoader, and build the scene graph.
// Allocate storage for cameras and lights, and process animation channels.
// Convert the scene to the correct handedness and winding order.
// Merge any loaded scenes into the primary scene, and handle special cases like skeleton meshes.
// If the scene lacks meshes or materials, mark it as incomplete and handle animations accordingly.
