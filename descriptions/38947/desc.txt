// Open and read an LWS file using the provided IOSystem and populate the aiScene object.
// - Open the LWS file using the IOSystem and check for errors.
// - Allocate a buffer and read the file contents into it.
// - Parse the file structure into an LWS::Element object.
// - Initialize a BatchLoader to handle recursive file imports.
// - Parse elements of the LWS file to construct a list of nodes describing the scene.
// - Handle various LWS commands like LoadObject, AddLight, and AddCamera to populate nodes and properties.
// - Resolve the parent-child relationships between nodes based on parsed data.
// - Load any additional files referenced in the LWS file and combine them into a master aiScene.
// - Apply necessary transformations and optimizations such as left-handed to right-handed conversions.
// - Finalize the scene setup by merging external scenes, resolving animations, and checking for completeness.
