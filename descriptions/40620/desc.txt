// Function to retrieve full section contents from a Binary File Descriptor (BFD).
// This function supports both uncompressed and compressed sections. If the section
// is compressed, it will decompress the data. It ensures proper memory allocation
// and handles different compression statuses, including none, sized, and done.
// It returns true if the contents are successfully retrieved and false otherwise,
// with appropriate error handling for memory allocation and size discrepancies.
