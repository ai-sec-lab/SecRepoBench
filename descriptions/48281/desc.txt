// Validate input buffer size and frame width
// - Ensure the buffer size is at least 4 bytes to have enough data for processing
// - Check that the frame width is at least 8 pixels, which is the minimum required width
// - Optionally, check if the frame width is a multiple of 8, ensuring proper alignment
// Return an error if any of these conditions are not met, indicating invalid data input.
