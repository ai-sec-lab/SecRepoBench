// This function writes a series of 16-bit tables, represented by cmsToneCurve structures,
// to an IO handler. Each table is part of a set of tone curves, and the number of tables
// and their entries are iterated over to write each value. The function ensures that all
// values are successfully written by checking the return status of the write operation.
// If any write fails, the function returns FALSE, otherwise, it returns TRUE upon successful
// completion of all writes. The contextHandle is unused in this function.
