// This function reads and processes the header of a DWARF line table,
// managing different DWARF versions and experimental tables. It first
// initializes pointers and reads the total length of the line table.
// The function then checks the DWARF version and processes fields like
// address size, segment selector size, and prologue length based on the
// version. It verifies that the table does not exceed its section and
// reads various attributes such as the minimum instruction length,
// line base, and opcode base. It also sets up an array for standard
// opcode lengths and checks for mismatches using the operandmismatch
// function. The function processes the include directories and file
// entries, handling both pre-DWARF5 and DWARF5 formats. For experimental
// line tables, it reads additional tables like subprograms and logicals.
// Finally, it updates the starting pointer for the line table data
// after the header and performs error handling throughout.
