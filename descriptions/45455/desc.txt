// Parse an entity reference from the XML parser context. If an entity
// reference is found, check if it's a predefined internal entity. For predefined
// entities, extract their content and provide it to the SAX character callback
// handler if SAX is enabled and not disabled. Set the 'was_checked' variable to
// the checked state of the entity for further processing. If no entity is found
// or other conditions are not met, return from the function early.
