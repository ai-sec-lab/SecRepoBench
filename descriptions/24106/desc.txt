// If the MVG class exists, insert its contents into the current stream.
// Calculate the offset from the start of the primitive string.
// Allocate a new string, copy the current primitive up to the offset, append the class contents, and then append the rest of the primitive.
// Replace the original primitive string with the new one, adjusting the position pointer accordingly.
