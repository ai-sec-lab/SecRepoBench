// This function processes a network packet captured by pcap, determining the data link type and parsing the packet
// headers accordingly to identify the protocol being used. It starts by declaring pointers for different types of
// headers such as Ethernet, LLC, Cisco HDLC, Radio Tap, Wifi, MPLS, IP, and IPv6 headers. It then initializes 
// variables to hold packet and header lengths, offsets, protocol types, and VLAN information. The process involves
// incrementing a raw packet counter, setting the packet capture time, and performing a safety check on the timestamp.
// The function supports various data link types such as Ethernet, Linux Cooked Capture, Radiotap, and others,
// extracting relevant header information and adjusting offsets for each type. It handles different protocols including
// VLAN, MPLS, PPPoE, and tunnels like GTPv1 and CAPWAP, updating statistics related to MPLS and VLAN packets.
// For IPv4 and IPv6 packets, it checks for fragmentation and handles nested protocols. Finally, it processes the packet
// by calling the `packet_processing` function, passing along relevant header information and the extracted protocol details.
