// Function to process and execute a series of RAR filters on archived data.
// The function retrieves and processes the current filter from a stack of filters.
// It checks if the filter stack is valid, calculates the data block to be filtered,
// and initializes a virtual machine (if needed) to execute the filter.
// The processed data is then stored back into the filter stack for further processing.
// The function handles special cases for different filter types and manages the
// lifecycle of the filters and the associated memory resources.
