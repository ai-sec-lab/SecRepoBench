// Parse a node line from the file, which includes reading and storing bone
// information. This involves parsing the bone index, name, and parent index.
// Start by skipping spaces and line ends, then parse the bone index. Check 
// for unexpected EOF/EOL, and resize the bones vector if the index is larger 
// than the current size. Parse the bone name, which may or may not be enclosed 
// in double quotes, and handle both cases appropriately. Parse the parent index 
// for the bone, handling potential parsing errors, and store the parsed data 
// in the bone structure. Finally, move to the beginning of the next line.
