// Function to decompress a buffer using an optional context. 
// It first checks if the Blosc library is initialized. 
// An environment variable `BLOSC_NTHREADS` is checked for setting the number of threads. 
// If `BLOSC_NOLOCK` is set, it uses a decompression context created with the current number of threads.
// Otherwise, it uses a global mutex to ensure thread safety and decompresses the data with the global context.
