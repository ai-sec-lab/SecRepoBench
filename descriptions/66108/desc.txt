// Process MP3 frames from the input buffer. If an ID3v2 tag is encountered,
		// it is extracted and stored, and processing continues until a complete MP3 frame
		// is found. If an ID3v1 tag is detected, it is skipped. The function handles
		// frame synchronization, packet creation, and CTS (Composition Time Stamp) updates.
		// When an MP3 frame is ready, it is packaged into a filter packet with
		// appropriate timing and framing properties before being sent downstream.
		// The loop manages input buffer advancement and handles the end-of-stream scenario.
