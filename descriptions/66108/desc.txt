// Check if the size of the data plus an offset is less than the remaining bytes, after accounting for skipped bytes.
// Ensure the synchronization byte at the calculated position is valid (0xFF).
// If the following bytes form the string "TAG", mark for skipping ID3v1 metadata.
// Log a message and reset synchronization status if the frame is invalid and resynchronization is needed.
// If the packet is not complete and there is more data to be processed, exit the loop and wait for the next frame,
// unless it's the end of the stream.
