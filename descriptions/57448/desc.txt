// Concatenate the extracted domain name (dNSName) to the server_names field
// within the tls_quic structure of the flow object. If server_names is
// initially NULL, assign the dNSName directly to it. Otherwise, reallocate
// memory to append the new dNSName to the existing server_names, separated by
// a comma. Update the server_names_len field to reflect the new length of
// server_names after appending.
