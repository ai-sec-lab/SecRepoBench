// Apply dynamic range and gain scaling to the transform coefficients for each channel.
// Determine the appropriate audio channel based on the channel mode.
// In dual mono mode, adjust the channel index accordingly.
// Choose the gain value based on whether heavy compression is enabled and if compression exists for the channel.
// For fixed-point processing, use a dedicated scaling function.
// For floating-point processing, incorporate an additional gain adjustment for the target level.
// Convert and scale the fixed coefficients to floating-point transform coefficients.
