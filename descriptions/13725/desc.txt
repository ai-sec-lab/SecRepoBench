// Loop through a sequence of data representations, extracting each 16-bit value from the tvb buffer.
// For each value, add an entry to the data_representation_seq_subtree, formatting it with the index,
// the string representation of the value from data_representation_kind_vals, and the hexadecimal value.
// Increment the offset by 2 bytes for each entry processed in the sequence.
