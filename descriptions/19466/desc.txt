// Extract the server name from the TLS packet payload, which is likely embedded
// as a distinguished name (DN) within the certificate. Identify if this name
// appears to be a valid host name or an IP address by checking for a printable
// string and presence of at least one dot. If a valid name is detected, store
// it in the provided buffer and associate it with the flow's server certificate.
// Use the server name to attempt to identify a subprotocol using ndpi's protocol
// matching capabilities. If a match is found, update the flow's detected protocol.
// Return 1 to indicate that a server certificate has been successfully identified.
