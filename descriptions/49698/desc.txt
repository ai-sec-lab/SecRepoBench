// Decompress the Huffman encoded data from the compressed buffer into the
// raw output buffer using Huffman decoding. First, check the compressed
// data size and spare bytes for validity. Then, read necessary header
// information from the compressed data, including the number of bits and
// encoded size limits. Decide whether to use a fast Huffman decoder or a
// standard one based on whether the fast decoder is enabled and the number
// of bits is sufficiently large. For the fast decoder, initialize and
// execute it using the context and spare buffer provided. For the standard
// decoder, unpack the encoding table, build the decoding table, and
// perform the decoding process, storing the result in the raw buffer.
