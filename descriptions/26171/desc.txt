// This part is responsible for decompressing a single block of data in the Blosc library. 
// It handles the extraction of compressed data streams and applies any required decompression 
// filters or algorithms. The block begins by setting up necessary context and variables, such as 
// determining the compression format, the number of streams, and any filters to apply. 
// It iterates over the data streams within the block, decompressing each one based on its format,
// and copying the decompressed data to the destination buffer. Special handling is included for 
// run-length encoded data (where the number of bytes is negative), and potential errors are 
// checked for throughout the process. If any decompression filters were applied, they are 
// executed at the end of the operation. The function returns the total number of uncompressed 
// bytes processed.
