// Initialize variables and check if the block should be decompressed
// by assessing context flags and the block maskout array. If the block
// should not be decompressed, return the block size as the decompressed size.
// Adjust the source pointer by the given source offset, and determine if
// filters are to be applied, setting the appropriate destination buffer.
// Determine the number of data streams for the block based on context flags
// and the presence of leftover blocks or dictionary use.
// For each stream, read and interpret the compressed byte size and proceed
// to decompress the data using the appropriate decompression algorithm
// based on the compression format. Handle special cases for runs
// (indicating repeated values) and errors such as unsupported formats
// or mismatch in expected decompressed size. Accumulate decompressed
// data size and update pointers for subsequent streams.
