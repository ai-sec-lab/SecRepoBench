// Extract the realm from the packet's payload if the conditions are met.
// The realm is extracted by reading the length of the realm string,
// ensuring it is within the payload's boundaries, copying the realm
// into a buffer, and converting it to lowercase. If the realm is extracted
// successfully, it is stored in the 'domain' field of the flow's Kerberos
// protocol structure. If packet reassembly was used, free any previously
// allocated buffer and restore the original packet payload and length.
