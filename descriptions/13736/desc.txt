// Iterate through each font dictionary, checking if it is included in the
// remap. If included, update the current font dictionary offset using the
// calculated serialized size of the font dictionary. Increment the offset
// counter to prepare for the next dictionary's offset calculation. Also,
// increment the font dictionary index counter for each valid dictionary.
