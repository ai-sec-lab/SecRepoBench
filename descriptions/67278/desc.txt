// Check if the base sample rate index (base_sr_index) from the audio configuration (acfg)
// is out of bounds for the GF_M4ASampleRates array or if the sample rate value is zero.
// If either condition is true, set nb_frames to 0 and exit the loop by breaking.
// This ensures the LATM frame is valid before proceeding with further processing.
