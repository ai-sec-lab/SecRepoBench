// Validate the slice information for the HuffYUV MT codec.
// Ensure that the calculated offset based on the number of slices and slice info offset
// does not exceed the buffer size minus 16, which can indicate incorrect data.
// Additionally, check that the slice height is a positive value.
// In one variant, also verify that the total height covered by the slices does not exceed
// the image height, which ensures that no slices go beyond the image bounds.
// If any of these conditions are met, return an error indicating invalid data.
