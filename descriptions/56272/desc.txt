// Extract host and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) information from the packet payload.
// First, validate that the payload length is sufficient to contain at least one tuple.
// Then, parse the number of tuples from the payload and verify it is valid.
// Iterate through the tuples, extracting the type and value pairs, and identify if a
// tuple corresponds to a hostname or an FQDN by checking specific string identifiers.
// If a hostname or FQDN is found, store the respective string value in the flow structure.
// Handle potential partial packet parsing by ensuring that all tuples are processed
// or report an error if parsing is incomplete.
