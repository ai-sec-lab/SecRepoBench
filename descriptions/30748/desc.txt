// Parse and populate the metalayer information from the header. This includes
// extracting the metalayer name and its associated serialized content. The
// function performs several checks to ensure that the header position does not
// exceed its length and that the expected data types are correct. Each metalayer
// is appended to the superchunk's metalayers array, with memory dynamically
// allocated for storing names and contents.
