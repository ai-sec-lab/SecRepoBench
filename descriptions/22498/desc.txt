// Parse the payload of a packet to identify and extract lines separated by the CR+NL ("\r\n") sequence.
// For each line found, determine its length and attempt to parse HTTP header lines such as "Server:",
// "Host:", "Content-Type:", etc., extracting key information and updating appropriate packet structures.
// If a double CR+NL ("\r\n\r\n") sequence is detected, handle it as a possible end of headers section
// in HTTP, and store any subsequent binary data. Update packet information regarding the lines parsed
// and any HTTP-specific data identified. The parsing loop continues until either all payload bytes are
// processed or a maximum number of lines is reached.
