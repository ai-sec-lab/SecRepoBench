// This function parses a numeric value from a string, starting at the character pointer `p`
// and stopping at the character pointer `end`. It iterates over each digit in the string,
// converting it to an integer and accumulating the value in `next_n`, which is cast from the
// initial value pointed to by `valp`. Upon successful parsing, `next_n` is assigned to `*valp`, 
// and the function returns a pointer to the character following the parsed number.
