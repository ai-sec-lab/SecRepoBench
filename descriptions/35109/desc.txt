// Parses a numeric value from the format string, updating the provided pointer `valp`.
// Iterates over the characters in the range [p, end), continuing while the character is a digit.
// Builds the number incrementally, checking for overflow during multiplication and addition operations.
// If the parsing reaches the end of the string without encountering a non-digit, raises an error.
// Once parsed, updates `valp` with the new number and returns the current position `p` in the string.
