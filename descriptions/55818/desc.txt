// Calculate the maximum index `cmax` for the compound word check.
// Loop through characters to determine the position where a compound word can end.
// Ensure the position doesn't break any UTF-8 character boundaries by skipping continuation bytes.
// Start from the end of the word and decrease `cmax` based on the minimum compound length `cpdmin`.
