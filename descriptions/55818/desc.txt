// Calculate the minimum and maximum positions in the UTF-8 encoded word
// corresponding to the first and last 'cpdmin' number of characters, respectively.
// Adjust 'cmin' to point to the start of the first character and 'cmax' to point
// just past the end of the last character, considering UTF-8 continuation bytes.
// This is done only when 'utf8' is true; otherwise, use 'cpdmin' for cmin and
// calculate cmax based on the word length and cpdmin.
