// Parse the flags string, where flags are represented as decimal numbers
// separated by commas. Convert each number from the string into an unsigned
// short and store them in the result array. If a flag value is larger than
// the allowed maximum (DEFAULTFLAGS), or if it is zero, log a warning using
// the HUNSPELL_WARNING macro. Advance the source pointer to the next number
// after encountering a comma, and continue this process until all numbers are
// converted and stored in the result array.
