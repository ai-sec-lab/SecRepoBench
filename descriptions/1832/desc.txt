// Read matrix parameters for the specified substream. It initializes and validates
// the number of primitive matrices, ensuring that they do not exceed the maximum
// allowed for the codec type (MLP or TrueHD). The function iterates over each matrix
// to read its output channel, fractional bits, and least significant bit (LSB) bypass
// flag, checking for errors in the process. If a matrix is valid, its coefficients and
// noise shift (if applicable) are set. Upon error, the number of matrices is reset to
// zero, and an error code is returned. Both snippets perform these operations, but they
// differ in how they handle errors during matrix processing.
