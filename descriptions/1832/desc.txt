// Function to read matrix parameters from the bitstream.
// This function handles the reading of parameters for primitive matrices
// used in the decoding process of MLP or TrueHD streams. It reads the number
// of matrices, output channels, fractional bits, and coefficients for each
// matrix. Depending on the codec type (MLP or TrueHD), it ensures the number
// of matrices does not exceed a defined maximum. It also performs validation
// checks such as ensuring that the specified output channels do not exceed
// the maximum allowed matrix channels and that the number of fractional bits
// does not exceed 14. If the noise type is not present, additional channels
// are considered for matrix processing. In case of errors, appropriate error
// messages are logged, and error handling is performed.
