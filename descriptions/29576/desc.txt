// This part handles reading group information from an HDF5 dataset 
// associated with a MATLAB structure or sparse matrix. It checks for the 
// presence of MATLAB-specific attributes like "MATLAB_sparse" and "MATLAB_fields"
// to determine the type and structure of the dataset. If the dataset is 
// identified as sparse, it updates the dimensions and checks if it is complex.
// For structures, it retrieves field names either from attributes or by 
// iterating over group links. It sets the dimensions for scalar structures 
// and allocates memory for storing fields. Each field is processed based on 
// its type (dataset or group), reading its information or reference data.
