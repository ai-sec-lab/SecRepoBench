// Traverse backwards from the specified position to identify the start of the UTF-8 character at that position.
// Convert the identified UTF-8 characters into a sequence of UTF-16 characters.
// Extract two UTF-16 characters from this sequence, if available, and check their uppercase status using a language-specific function.
// If either of these characters is already in uppercase and neither is a hyphen, return 1 to indicate a condition is met.
