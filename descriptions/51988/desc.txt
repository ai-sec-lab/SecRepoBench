// This code checks for compounding issues with neighboring characters
// of differing cases at a specified position in the input string.
// It handles both UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 encodings. 
// For UTF-8, it converts the characters around the position to Unicode
// and checks if either of them is an uppercase letter that is not a hyphen.
// For non-UTF-8, it uses a case conversion table to verify if 
// either neighboring character is uppercase and not a hyphen.
// If a case inconsistency is detected, it returns 1, indicating a 
// potential compounding error.
