// Check the packet's payload for specific BitTorrent protocol signatures, including
// known header strings and heuristics for identifying protocol v0. If a match is found,
// mark the connection as BitTorrent and extract any relevant information, such as
// protocol-specific hashes, from the payload. If no immediate signature is detected,
// increment the BitTorrent detection stage counter. If the detection stage is below
// a certain threshold, continue inspecting the payload for other BitTorrent-specific
// keywords and patterns, and attempt to extract a hash from the payload if possible.
// Finally, log the detection and classify the connection as BitTorrent with a specified
// confidence level. If no signature is found after a number of attempts, skip further
// BitTorrent detection for this packet.
