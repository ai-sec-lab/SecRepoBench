// This function decodes a DFPWM frame from the given AVPacket. It initializes
// the DFPWMState and AVFrame structures, calculates the number of samples
// based on the packet size and channel layout, and checks for validity. It then
// allocates a buffer for the frame using ff_get_buffer. If successful, it calls
// au_decompress to perform the decompression of the audio data from the packet
// into the frame buffer. Finally, it sets got_frame to indicate a frame was
// successfully decoded and returns the size of the packet processed.
