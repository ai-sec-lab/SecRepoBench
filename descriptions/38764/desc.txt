// Iterate over the directory entries in the buffer, processing each entry to
// build a list of child file information structures. Skip special directory
// entries '.' and '..'. For each valid entry, parse its information and handle
// multi-extent files by linking their content pieces together. Allocate memory
// for storing additional content segments if needed, and update the multi-extent
// file's total size. Add each processed file entry to the archive, and handle
// any errors related to memory allocation or parsing failures. Adjust the
// buffer pointer and remaining step size appropriately during the iteration.
