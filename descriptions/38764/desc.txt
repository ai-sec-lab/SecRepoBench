// Loop through directory records in a sector, each entry is processed
// until a null entry or the end of the buffer is reached. For each entry,
// it checks for special directory identifiers '.' and '..' and skips them.
// For each valid entry, it attempts to parse it into a file_info structure.
// If the entry is part of a multi-extent file, it aggregates the extents.
// Finally, each valid parsed file entry is added to the list of entries
// to be processed next.
