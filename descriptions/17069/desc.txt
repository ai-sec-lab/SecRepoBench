// Process each value in the given array by reading and decoding a sequence of Rice-encoded signed integers from the bitstream.
// The loop iterates over each value to read the unary and binary parts of the Rice code.
// It begins by counting the number of leading zeros to determine the unary part (MSBs) of the Rice code.
// If more bits are needed, it continues to the next word in the buffer.
// After acquiring the unary part, the binary part (LSBs) is extracted based on the given parameter.
// The complete value is reconstructed from the unary and binary parts and stored in the output array.
// If necessary, additional bitstream words are consumed until each value is decoded.
// The number of consumed bits and words are updated in the bitreader before returning.
