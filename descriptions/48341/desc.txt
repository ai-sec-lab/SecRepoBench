// Handle different methods of reading TIFF image data, including reading
// from strips, tiles, or using a generic reading method. For each method,
// allocate necessary memory for pixel data, determine the appropriate
// quantum type based on the current channel being processed, and read
// pixel data from the TIFF structure into the image object. For strip and
// tile methods, iterate through the image rows and columns, importing the
// pixel data into the image, while managing the pixel data buffer for each
// strip or tile. If the image method is generic, read the entire image
// into a buffer, then iterate over the buffer to set pixel values in the
// image. After processing, release any allocated memory and update the
// image progress status.
