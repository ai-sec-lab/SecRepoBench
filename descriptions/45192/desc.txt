// The `unpack_BER` function is responsible for unpacking a BER-encoded integer from a byte array.
// It iterates over the bytes in the source (`src`) array, decoding each byte according to BER
// (Basic Encoding Rules). The decoded integer is built by shifting the previously accumulated
// value by 7 bits and OR-ing with the current byte (masked with 0x7f). The loop stops once a byte
// with the most significant bit unset (indicating the end of the BER encoding) is encountered.
// If the accumulated value exceeds the maximum representable integer (`MRB_INT_MAX`), a range
// error is raised. The decoded integer is then pushed onto the provided array (`ary`), and the
// function returns the number of bytes processed.
