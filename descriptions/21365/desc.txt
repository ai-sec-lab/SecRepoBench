// Interpret the NetBIOS name from the packet payload starting at the calculated offset.
// If the interpretation is successful, store the interpreted name in the flow's host server name.
// Determine the detected protocol for the flow. If the sub_protocol is unknown, set the protocol
// to NETBIOS with an unknown sub-protocol. Otherwise, set the detected protocol to the given
// sub_protocol with NETBIOS as the main protocol.
