// This function is responsible for extracting a token from a given string `start` and 
// copying it into the `parsedString` buffer. The function processes the input string 
// character by character, handling whitespace, quotes, escape characters, and 
// special syntax cases like URLs, numbers, and symbols. It starts by skipping 
// initial whitespace and then identifies the type of token (e.g., quoted strings, 
// numbers, special symbols) based on the first character. It uses a switch-case 
// structure to process different token types, handling escape characters and 
// ensuring tokens are copied to the `parsedString` buffer without exceeding 
// its specified `extent` length. If the token is a URL starting with "url(", 
// it adjusts the `parsedString` to remove the "url(" prefix. After processing, 
// it updates the `end` pointer to point to the character after the parsed token.
