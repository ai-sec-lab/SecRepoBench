// Initialize pointers to different segments of compressed data within the input buffer.
// Convert and decode the header information to determine sizes for different data segments
// (UNKNOWN, AC, DC, RLE) and compression types. Allocate necessary buffers and determine
// the starting points for various data segments like AC and DC within the compressed data.
// Establish rules for channel processing based on the version. Ensure the compressed data
// does not exceed the bounds of the input data. Prepare to uncompress data segments by
// setting pointers to the beginning of each compressed segment: UNKNOWN, AC, DC, RLE.
