// Extracts and processes pilot record data from a buffer. It first retrieves the pilot record type and record length from the buffer.
// Then, it creates a tree item for type-specific fields and appends hexadecimal values of each byte within the record length to it.
// Adjusts the offset as it processes each byte of data.
