// This code block is responsible for copying a Coding Tree Block (CTB) of pixel
// data from the source buffer to the destination buffer, handling both aligned
// and unaligned memory accesses. The copy operation is optimized for cases
// where the width of the data is a multiple of 8. It uses a loop to copy data
// in chunks of 64 bits using the AV_COPY64U macro. If the width is not a
// multiple of 8, it handles the remaining unaligned bytes separately after the
// main loop.
