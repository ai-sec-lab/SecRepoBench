// Attempt to retrieve the next TLV record by calculating the next record's
// starting position based on the current record's pointer and total size.
// Check if the calculated next record is within the valid memory bounds
// defined by the TLV data buffer and its length. If the next record is
// valid and within bounds, assign its pointer to the result record; otherwise,
// assign a null value to indicate an invalid or out-of-bounds record.
