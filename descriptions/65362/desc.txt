// The masked code block is responsible for processing the "signature_algorithms" extension
// within a TLS ClientHello message. It extracts the length of the signature algorithms list
// and iterates through it, storing the algorithms in the `ja` structure and recording the 
// algorithms as a string for JA3 fingerprinting. The code also checks for duplicate algorithms 
// and updates browser heuristics based on known signatures for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
// Specifically, it identifies which algorithms are used and sets flags for known browser 
// TLS fingerprinting. The masked code block involves processing of payload to extract 
// and analyze the signature algorithms list for TLS fingerprinting purposes.
