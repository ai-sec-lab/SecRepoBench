// Determine the number of vertices in the primitive_info by iterating until
// an UndefinedPrimitive is found. Allocate memory for the dash_polygon array
// based on twice the number of vertices plus a few additional elements to
// accommodate extra points for drawing. If memory allocation fails, return
// MagickFalse to indicate failure. Clone the draw_info into clone_info to
// use for subsequent drawing operations.
