// Restore the state of the iteration by resetting the index `i` to a previous position stored in `soldi`.
// Reassign the string `st` to its original state using `word` to ensure the word construction is accurate.
// Reset additional tracking variables as necessary to their prior values.
// If there is no need to restore the state, replace the current character in `st` with a stored character `ch`.
// This process ensures the function can handle different compound word possibilities correctly.
