// Process each pixel for a 64-bit floating-point depth within the CMYKA
// colorspace. For each pixel, retrieve the individual CMYKA components
// from the input stream using double precision. Convert these values
// to quantum format and assign them to the respective color channels
// (Red, Green, Blue, Black, and Alpha) of the output image. Move the
// input pointer past each processed component and apply padding as
// specified by quantum_info. Advance the output pointer to the next
// pixel position based on the number of channels.
