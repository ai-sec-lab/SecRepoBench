// Calculate the number of glyphs by computing the difference between
// the maximum and minimum glyph codepoints, and store this count.
// Initialize the starting glyph codepoint with the minimum value.
// Serialize the class values using the serialization context and glyph count.
// Iterate over the glyph-class pairs and assign class values to the
// corresponding indices in the classValue object, adjusted by the minimum glyph.
