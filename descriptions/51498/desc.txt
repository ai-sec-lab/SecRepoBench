// Perform pattern matching and replacement on the word being processed, utilizing
// the checkcpdtable to find applicable patterns. If a pattern match is found based
// on the current index and substring of the word, replace the matched substring
// with corresponding patterns defined in the table. Adjust tracking variables
// accordingly, including updating string length and character bounds, and setting
// a break condition if no pattern is found. Mark the position in the string where
// the next operation should occur and store the current character for further
// processing.
