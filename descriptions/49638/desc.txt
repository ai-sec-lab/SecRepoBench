// This function extracts the IP and port information from the packet's payload, 
// specifically when the payload begins with the "IP=" prefix followed by the 
// expected ",PORT=" separator. The function checks if the payload is long enough 
// and contains the correct format. It locates the ",PORT=" separator, calculates 
// the lengths of the IP and port strings, and then copies the strings into the 
// flow structure's softether IP and port fields. If the conditions are not met 
// or parsing fails, the function returns 1 indicating an error. On successful 
// parsing, it returns 0.
