// Check for the terminating '>' character indicating the end of a data block.
// If the termination character is found, advance the position in the context,
// transfer the byte data to the plist node, and release the byte array resources.
// If the termination character is missing, set an error in the context and
// free allocated resources. Finally, append the constructed node to the plist
// and continue parsing by skipping any subsequent whitespace characters.
