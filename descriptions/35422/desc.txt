// ConcatenateStringInfo() appends the contents of the source StringInfo
// to the destination StringInfo, ensuring enough memory is allocated to
// accommodate the combined length of the two string data. It handles
// memory allocation and reallocation for the resulting string, and 
// updates the destination's length appropriately. It throws a fatal 
// exception if memory allocation fails.
