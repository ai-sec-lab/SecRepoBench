// Key schedule generation for AES encryption and decryption.
// Iterates through the given key to produce round keys for each round
// of encryption/decryption. The process involves using the S-Box for 
// substitution and applying the round constant (rcon) to the key.
// It also considers the special case when the key count (KC) is 8,
// which requires an additional substitution step at the midpoint.
// The generated round keys are stored in the 'round_key' structure of 
// the AVAES instance, which will later be used for the encryption or 
// decryption process.
