// Iterate over a series of predefined ranges to map glyph indices to their
// corresponding SID (Symbol Identifier). For each range, retrieve the
// starting SID and the count of consecutive SIDs. Incrementally assign
// SIDs to glyph indices starting from gid=1, updating the mapping as you
// go. Stop the process once the gid reaches or exceeds the specified
// number of glyphs (num_glyphs).
