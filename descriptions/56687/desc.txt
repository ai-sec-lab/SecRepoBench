// Define additional instance methods for the IO class. These methods include
// functionality for setting and querying the 'close on exec' flag, checking
// if the IO object is closed, retrieving the process ID, obtaining the file
// descriptor number, and writing data. Depending on the specific requirement,
// a method to get the current position in the IO stream may also be defined.
