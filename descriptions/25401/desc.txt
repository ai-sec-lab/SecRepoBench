// Function to read the first skin from a sequence of skin data blocks.
// Validates that the number of skins and the cursor are non-zero or non-null.
// Reads the type of the skin from the current cursor position and adjusts the cursor.
// It handles situations where there might be additional bytes to skip before reading
// the actual type. If the type is zero, it moves the cursor to read the type again.
// Reads the width and height of the skin, then allocates a new material.
// Parses the skin data using a function specifically for 3D GameStudio MDL7 skin lumps.
// Iterates over any remaining skins, reading and skipping each one using their type,
// width, and height. Sets up the material to be used in the scene and updates the cursor output parameter.
