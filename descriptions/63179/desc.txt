// Convert the integer value to a string and append it to the serializer's buffer,
// ensuring that the buffer has sufficient space by extending it if necessary.
// If the CSV header has not been written yet, write it before serializing the value.
// Update the buffer usage to reflect the serialized data. This process is part of
// the CSV serialization format, where the key is ignored.
