// This loop skips all leading whitespace characters (\n, \r, \t, and space)
// in the 'probe_data' string. It stops when a non-whitespace character is
// encountered or the end of the string is reached. In Snippet 2, it also
// decrements 'probe_size' to keep track of the remaining size of the buffer.
