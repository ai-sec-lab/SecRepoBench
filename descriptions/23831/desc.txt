// Check if the packet length is exactly 12, indicating a specific IAX packet format.
// If so, log the detection of the IAX packet and add the connection to the detection module.
// Otherwise, iterate over the packet's payload elements, verifying and calculating the total
// length of the payload elements to determine if it matches the packet length.
// If a match is found, log the detection of the IAX packet and add the connection.
// This process is used to identify and confirm the presence of IAX protocol within the packet.
