// Check if the packet payload matches specific patterns associated with the LINE protocol.
// The function examines the payload length and certain byte values at specific positions in the packet.
// If the payload matches any of these predefined patterns, the function adds the current connection
// to the LINE protocol connections list and returns, indicating that the LINE protocol has been detected
// in the current packet. This is part of a heuristic method used to identify LINE protocol traffic.
