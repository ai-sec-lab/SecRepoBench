// This function reads and processes a 'cart' chunk in a WAVE file.
// It first checks if the chunk size is within valid limits, logging
// and skipping the chunk if it's too small or too large. Then, it
// attempts to allocate memory for a SF_CART_INFO_16K structure to
// store the cart data, freeing any existing cart data to avoid memory
// leaks. The function reads various fields from the chunk into the
// structure, including version, title, artist, and others. If the
// chunk contains additional tag text beyond the minimum size, it reads
// and stores that as well. The function returns 0 on successful
// processing or an error code if memory allocation fails.
