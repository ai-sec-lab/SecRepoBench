// This part implements the reading of a "cart" chunk within a WAVE file.
// The function checks if the chunk size falls within predefined minimum and maximum
// sizes. If the size is invalid, it logs an error and skips the chunk. If a valid
// size is detected, it allocates memory for storing cart chunk data using a
// struct called SF_CART_INFO_16K. It reads various fields like version, title, artist,
// cut_id, and other metadata fields related to the cart chunk from the file.
// Additionally, it handles optional tag text if present beyond the minimum chunk size.
// The function ensures memory management by freeing any previously allocated cart data
// before allocating new memory.
