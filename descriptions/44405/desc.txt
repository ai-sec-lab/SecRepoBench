// This part parses specific HTTP headers from a packet's payload lines.
// It identifies various headers such as "Server", "Host", "X-Forwarded-For",
// "Authorization", "Accept", "Referer", "User-Agent", "Content-Encoding",
// "Transfer-Encoding", "Content-Length", "Content-Disposition", "Cookie",
// "Origin", "X-Session-Type", and "Content-Type".
// For each header type, it adjusts pointers to the actual header values and updates the length accordingly.
// The code also counts the number of headers found in the packet and adjusts some for clients that
// might omit spaces after the header colon. The parsing process checks for both case-sensitive and
// case-insensitive matches to ensure robust detection and extraction of header information.
