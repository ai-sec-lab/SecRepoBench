// Parse various HTTP header fields from packet lines, storing the
// pointer and length of each detected header within the packet
// structure. The function identifies headers such as Authorization,
// Accept, Referer, User-Agent, Content-Encoding, Transfer-Encoding,
// Content-Length, Content-Disposition, Cookie, Origin, X-Session-Type,
// and others. It also counts the number of recognized headers.
// When parsing headers, it skips any leading spaces in the header value.
// If certain headers like Content-Type appear more than once, it handles
// subsequent appearances appropriately by checking the existing content line.
