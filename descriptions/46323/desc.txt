// Insert the copied node 'copy' as a child of the 'insert' node. If 'insert'
// has no children, 'copy' is set as the first child. Otherwise, 'copy' is
// appended to the list of children. Update the 'last' pointer of 'insert' to
// point to 'copy'. If the current node 'cur' has children, update 'cur' to
// its first child and set 'insert' to 'copy', then continue the loop to
// recursively copy the child nodes.
