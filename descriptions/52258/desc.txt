// The function calculates the length of the left common substring between
// sourceString1 and s2. If complexprefixes is enabled, it checks if the last
// character of sourceString1 matches the last character of s2, considering their
// lengths. Otherwise, it iterates through the strings, comparing characters
// while accounting for capitalization using the csconv mapping. Returns the
// length of the matching prefix or zero if they do not match initially.
