// This part handles the dissection of the DMX dictionary within the packet.
// It reads a byte value `idepar` from the `tvb` buffer at the current position,
// which is used to determine the type and length of data to be processed.
// If the `idepar` value indicates a void area, it processes accordingly
// by adding void or unknown items to the tree, adjusting `i` and `dictionary_size`.
// If `idepar` falls within the defined dimmer tag range, it processes a dimmer level subset.
// In all other cases, it processes the data as unknown.
// Once the word count is reached and words are found, it aligns the dictionary size to a 
// 4-byte boundary by adjusting `i` and incrementing `curr_size` until it is divisible by 4.
