// This function adjusts the dimensions of a video frame to meet alignment requirements
// for various pixel formats and codec-specific needs. It determines the width and height
// alignment based on the pixel format, codec type, and other properties of the video.
// Specific codecs like H.264, VC1, and others have additional height and width requirements
// due to their internal processing needs, such as handling edge emulation. For each of the
// four data pointers, the function sets the linesize alignment, ensuring consistent memory
// access patterns during processing.
