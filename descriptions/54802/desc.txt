// Implement payload analysis for PPStream detection over UDP.
// Check specific patterns in the packet's payload to identify PPStream protocol.
// Look for particular byte sequences at various offsets in the payload to determine
// if the packet matches known PPStream signatures.
// If a match is found, increment the PPStream stage counter for the flow
// and add the connection to the PPStream detection list.
// Return from the function once a PPStream pattern is successfully matched and processed.
