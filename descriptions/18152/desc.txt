// Process extra null bytes if needed and update the query name length.
// Read the remaining data after the query name from the input stream.
// Perform byte swapping on the data if the input stream is in big-endian format.
// Convert optional tags to CIGAR operations and check the conversion result.
// If there are CIGAR operations present, recompute the "bin" value for indexing
// and verify the consistency between CIGAR and query sequence lengths.
// Return the total read block length if successful.
