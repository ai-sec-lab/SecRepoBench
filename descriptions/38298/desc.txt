// The masked section handles calculating the length of a subarray to be
// spliced. It determines how many elements will be affected by the operation
// starting from the specified head index. If the head index is within the
// array bounds, it computes the length as the difference between the total
// array length and the head index. An additional step in the process might
// involve recalculating the tail index to ensure that the operation does not
// exceed array bounds.
