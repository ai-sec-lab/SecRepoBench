// Allocate memory for the coefficients and points needed to trace the
// Bezier curve. Calculate the number of control points by adjusting
// the quantum size based on the number of coordinates and a defined
// Bezier quantum limit. Check if memory allocation was successful and
// if the primitive extent can accommodate the required number of control
// points. If any allocation or extent check fails, release any acquired
// memory and return a failure status.
