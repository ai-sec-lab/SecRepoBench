// Handle UTF-8 multibyte characters during text conversion. 
// This code specifically deals with UTF-8 sequences of 3 bytes (0xe0) and 4 bytes (0xf0).
// It checks the byte patterns to determine the character length and ensures the buffer has enough space before copying the bytes. 
// If a valid UTF-8 character is found, it copies it to the destination buffer, otherwise, it continues to the next character.
