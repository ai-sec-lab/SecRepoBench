// Perform division of large numbers represented as arrays of limbs, calculating
// the quotient and remainder. The division is done by estimating the quotient
// limb by limb using the most significant digits, then adjusting the temporary
// dividend to subtract the product of the estimated quotient and the divisor.
// This process is repeated for each limb of the dividend to construct the full
// quotient, correcting any overestimation by decrementing the estimated quotient
// if necessary. Finally, the computed quotient is stored in `q`, which will
// eventually be copied to `qq`, while the remainder is adjusted and stored in `rr`.
