// Implements the unsigned division operation for multi-precision integers.
// Handles special cases where the dividend is smaller than or equal to 
// the divisor. Uses long division technique: 
// - Aligns the dividend and divisor to have the leading digit of the divisor 
//   as a non-zero.
// - For each position, calculates the estimated quotient digit (qhat) and 
//   adjusts the dividend through subtraction.
// - Performs correction on qhat if necessary.
// - Uses right shift to adjust the remainder.
// Finalizes by setting the calculated quotient and remainder.
