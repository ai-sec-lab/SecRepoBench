// Allocate and initialize a new GF_ItemLocationEntry structure. This involves
// reading item ID and construction method depending on the version. If the version
// is less than 2, the item ID is read as a 16-bit integer; otherwise, as a 32-bit integer.
// The construction method is read if the version is 1 or 2. The data reference index
// and base offset are read, adjusting size accordingly. The base offset is stored both 
// in base_offset and original_base_offset when writing is enabled. Then, read the count 
// of extent entries, allocate them, and read extent index, offset, and length as per 
// the defined sizes. Ensure the extent index is read if the version is 1 or 2 and 
// index_size is greater than zero. Store extent offset in both extent_offset and 
// original_extent_offset when writing is enabled. Each of these entries is added 
// to the location entry's extent_entries list.
