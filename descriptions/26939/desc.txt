// The code block detects and repairs corrupt image profiles for specific types like XMP and EXIF.
// For XMP profiles, it removes any garbage data following the xpacket end marker.
// For EXIF profiles, it checks for and appends a missing "Exif" prefix if the profile starts with a byte order marker. 
// The function modifies the profile in place and can return a boolean to indicate if a repair was made.
