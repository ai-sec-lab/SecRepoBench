// Parse XML internal DOCTYPE declarations, handling entity and attribute list definitions.
// - Parse entity definitions: Entities are parsed with support for parameter entities and
//   general entities. External entity references are ignored.
// - Parse default attributes in ATTLIST declarations: These are parsed and stored in the XML
//   tree's attributes structure. This allows for default attribute values to be used.
// - Handle comments and processing instructions found within the DOCTYPE section.
// - Continue parsing until the end of the internal DOCTYPE is reached or an error occurs.
