// This function implements the "shift" operation on an array, which removes
// and returns one or more elements from the beginning of the array. If no
// argument is provided, it removes and returns the first element. If an integer
// argument 'n' is provided, it removes and returns the first 'n' elements as a 
// new array. Before removing elements, it checks if the array is frozen. 
// If 'n' is greater than the array's length, the entire array is returned. 
// The function handles shared arrays by adjusting the pointer and length, 
// and for non-shared arrays, it shifts elements as needed.
