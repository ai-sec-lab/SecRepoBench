// This part first determines if the codepage is Asian, which affects the destination buffer size.
// If the `HAVE_ICONV` macro is defined, it uses the `iconv` library for conversion.
// The conversion process involves using `iconv` to transform the source text into UTF-8.
// If the initial buffer is insufficient, it attempts to resize and retry the conversion.
// In case of errors or buffer overflows, it handles them by logging errors and falls back
// to a manual conversion function `bit_TV_to_utf8_codepage`. The conversion concludes
// by ensuring the output string is null-terminated and freeing any allocated resources.
