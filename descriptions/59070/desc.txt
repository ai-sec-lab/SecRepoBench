// Extract a null-terminated suffix string from input data, ensuring the 
// string length does not exceed 128 characters. Allocate memory for the 
// extracted string using the provided allocation function. If successful,
// copy the extracted string into the allocated memory and set the 
// Classifier's suffix pointer to the newly allocated memory. Handle errors
// for corrupt data or memory allocation failures appropriately.
