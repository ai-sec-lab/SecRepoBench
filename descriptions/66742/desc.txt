// This part parses the URL to extract the server name. It handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses by
// checking for '[' and ']' characters to identify IPv6 address segments. The loop iterates over the URL
// until it encounters a '/' or ':' character, provided it's not within an IPv6 segment. The extracted
// server name is stored in the 'text' array.
