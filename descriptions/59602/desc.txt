// Handle specific DWARF operations related to constant types, register values, and conversions.
// - For DW_OP_GNU_const_type, decode the DIE offset and obtain a value block size and its location,
//   adjusting pointers and offsets accordingly.
// - For DW_OP_regval_type and DW_OP_GNU_regval_type, decode two LEB128 unsigned integers which
//   represent register numbers and CU-relative DIE offsets, and update pointers and offsets.
// - For DW_OP_convert, DW_OP_GNU_convert, DW_OP_reinterpret, and DW_OP_GNU_reinterpret, decode
//   a single LEB128 unsigned integer which represents a DIE offset or zero, and adjust pointers
//   and offsets.
// - For DW_OP_GNU_parameter_ref, read a 4-byte unsigned integer, adjust pointers and offsets,
//   and handle potential errors if bounds are exceeded.
