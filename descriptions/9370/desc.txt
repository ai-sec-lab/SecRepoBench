// This code block reads EXIF properties from a TIFF image file and sets them as properties on an Image object.
// It checks if the TIFF library supports reading EXIF directories, then retrieves the offset of the EXIF IFD.
// It saves the current directory, reads the EXIF directory, and iterates over a predefined list of EXIF tags.
// For each tag, it retrieves the value based on its type and variable length, formats it as a string, and sets it as an image property.
// After processing all tags, it restores the original directory. If EXIF support is unavailable, the function simply returns.
