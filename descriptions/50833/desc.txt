// Initialize the formatters for input and output to indicate no specific transformation
// is required at this stage. Set the flag to allow changing the formatter, enabling
// the flexibility of format adjustment before the transformation is applied. This
// prepares the transform structure to handle cases where input and output formats
// are not specified, ensuring the transform can proceed with default handling.
