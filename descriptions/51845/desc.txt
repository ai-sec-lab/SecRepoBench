// Allocate and initialize a stab_find_info structure to manage stabs debugging information.
// Attempt to retrieve the .stab and .stabstr sections from the BFD. If these sections are not
// available, try using alternative SOM section names, $GDB_SYMBOLS$ and $GDB_STRINGS$.
// Retrieve and validate the sizes of these sections, allocating memory for their data.
// If the BFD is a relocatable object, compute and apply relocations to the .stab entries.
// Construct an index table matching function VM addresses to stabs entries, storing relevant
// debugging information such as filenames and function names. The index table is built in
// two passes: first to count required entries and then to populate the table. The entries
// are sorted by starting VM address for efficient lookup.
// Ensure proper cleanup and error handling by freeing allocated resources on failure.
