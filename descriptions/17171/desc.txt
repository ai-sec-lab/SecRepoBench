// This code block implements the `exsltCryptoRc4DecryptFunction`, an XPath extension function.
// It takes two arguments: a key and an encrypted string in hexadecimal format.
// It first checks and retrieves the input arguments, allocating necessary memory for processing.
// It then converts the hexadecimal string to a binary format and uses RC4 decryption with the provided key.
// The decrypted result is verified for valid UTF-8 encoding (in Snippet 2) before being returned as a string.
// Proper error handling and resource management are performed throughout the function to ensure stability.
