// Retrieve matrix data from two adjacent matrix stages for potential optimization.
// Ensure the first matrix has no input offset to proceed with matrix multiplication.
// Multiply the matrices to combine their transformations, storing the result in 'res'.
// Check if the resulting matrix 'res' is an identity matrix and if the offset is zero.
// If the resulting matrix is an identity matrix and there's no offset, mark it as 
// an identity operation, allowing the removal of these stages from the pipeline.
