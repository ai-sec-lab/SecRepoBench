// Retrieve matrix data from two consecutive matrix stages (Matrix1 and Matrix2).
// Ensure that the input offset for the first matrix (Data1) is zero.
// Perform matrix multiplication between Data2 and Data1 to obtain the result matrix 'res'.
// Check if the resulting matrix 'res' is an identity matrix and if the offset from Data2 is null.
// If both conditions are met, set IdentityMat to TRUE, indicating that the matrix operation can be omitted.
