// This function parses X.509 certificates from a TLS packet to extract relevant details,
// such as the subject and issuer distinguished names (DNs), and certificate validity dates.
// It looks for specific elements within the certificate, like Common Name, Country, Locality,
// State or Province, Organization Name, and Organization Unit, using specific identifiers in 
// the payload. It also processes the certificate validity period to check for expiration or 
// if the certificate is about to expire. The function updates relevant fields in the flow 
// structure to store extracted data, and performs checks for anomalies or risks, like 
// certificate mismatches or self-signed certificates. It uses helper functions for extracting 
// Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) sequences and normalizing printable strings.
