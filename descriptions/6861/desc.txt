// Determine the number of vertices in the primitive_info array by iterating until an
// UndefinedPrimitive is encountered. Allocate memory for the dash_polygon array, which
// will store twice the number of vertices plus a small buffer for additional vertices.
// If memory allocation fails, return MagickFalse to indicate an error. Clone the draw_info
// structure to create a separate instance, which will be used for rendering operations.
