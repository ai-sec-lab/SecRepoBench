// This function decodes the binary content of an ExtensionObject. It begins by
// looking up the data type associated with a given NodeId. If the type is unknown,
// the content is considered as already encoded as a ByteString. The function then
// allocates memory for the decoded data, if necessary, and skips the length field
// in the binary data. Finally, it uses a decoding function from a jump table to
// decode the content based on the determined data type.
