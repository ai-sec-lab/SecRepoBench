// The following part is responsible for parsing material properties 
// from an OBJ file format in the ObjFileMtlImporter class. It reads 
// through a buffer and identifies various material attributes based on 
// prefix characters. These characters determine the type of material 
// property being parsed, such as ambient, diffuse, or specular colors 
// ('K' followed by 'a', 'd', or 's'), transmission attributes ('T'), 
// alpha values ('d'), and others including textures ('m', 'b', 'r'), 
// illumination models ('i'), and anisotropy ('a'). For each recognized 
// property, the respective method like getColorRGBA or getFloatValue is 
// called to extract and set the value to the current material structure 
// within the model. Unrecognized lines in the data are skipped.
