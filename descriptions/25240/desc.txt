// This code block is responsible for parsing various material properties from
// an OBJ material file. Depending on the character being examined, it can parse
// ambient, diffuse, specular, emissive, transparent colors, and other material
// properties such as alpha, shineness, and index of refraction. It also handles
// different material parameters like transmission color and illumination model.
// For texture-related entries, it delegates to the getTexture() function. The
// function uses a switch statement to determine the property type, advancing
// the iterator as necessary and skipping lines when completed. It ensures that
// the appropriate material property is set for each recognized entry.
