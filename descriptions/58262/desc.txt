// This function reads the field names from a MATLAB struct attribute in an HDF5 dataset.
// It opens the attribute "MATLAB_fields" and retrieves its space and type identifiers.
// It then reads the field names into a dynamically allocated variable-length array (hvl_t).
// The function checks if memory allocation for field names is successful and assigns them 
// to the matVariable's internal field names. It also handles errors and cleans up resources 
// by closing the HDF5 identifiers and freeing allocated memory. If the operation is successful, 
// it updates the number of fields in the matVariable structure. The function returns an error 
// code indicating the success or failure of the operation.
