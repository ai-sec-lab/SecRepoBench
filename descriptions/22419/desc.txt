// Parse the Kerberos realm from the packet payload, starting at the determined
// realm offset. Iterate through the payload to find the marker indicating the
// beginning of the realm data, then extract and convert the realm name to
// lowercase. If the realm length is within bounds, store the realm name in
// the flow's Kerberos domain field, ensuring it fits within the allocated
// buffer. This process is part of handling an AS-REQ message in the Kerberos
// protocol, and debug information is optionally printed if enabled.
