// Read the initial part of the ZIPX stream, which includes specific
// header bytes and the LZMA parameters needed for processing. This
// step involves accessing a certain number of bytes from the stream
// to ensure there is enough data for subsequent operations. If the
// stream does not contain the necessary bytes, an error is set, and
// the function returns with a failure code.
