// Parse MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) headers from the packet starting at the current IP offset.
// Increment the MPLS counter in the workflow statistics. Set the packet type to IPv4 and update the IP offset
// by moving past the MPLS headers until the end of the MPLS stack (determined by the "bottom of stack" bit).
// Set a flag to recheck the type after parsing MPLS headers.
