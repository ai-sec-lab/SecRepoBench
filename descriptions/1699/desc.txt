// This function reads the matrix parameters for a given substream in an MLP
// or TrueHD audio stream. It verifies that the number of matrices being read
// does not exceed the maximum allowed, based on the codec type (MLP or
// TrueHD). It iterates through the specified number of matrices, reading
// each matrix's output channel, fractional bits, and whether LSB bypass is
// enabled. It also checks for valid matrix output channels and fractional
// bits. For each matrix, it reads the coefficients for each channel, applying
// a shift based on the number of fractional bits. If the noise type requires
// it, additional noise shift values are read. The function returns 0 on success
// or an error code if invalid data is encountered.
