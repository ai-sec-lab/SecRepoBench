// Attempt to switch the parser to a new character encoding using the handler.
// If a suitable handler is found and it is not "UTF-8", change the current
// encoding to the handler's encoding. If no handler is found, report an
// unsupported encoding error using the `htmlParseErr` function. Finally, free
// the memory allocated for the guessed encoding string.
