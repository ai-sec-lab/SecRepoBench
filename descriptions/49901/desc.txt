// Handles VALUE_UNISTR case in the switch statement of the dissect_softether_type function.
// Checks if the payload length is at least 4 bytes to proceed with extraction.
// Assigns the raw pointer to point to the payload data offset by 4 bytes.
// Reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from the payload to determine the size of the data.
// Ensures that the extracted size is non-zero and that the payload has enough length to accommodate the data plus 3 additional bytes.
// If the value type is VALUE_DATA, decrements the size by one.
// Sets the value size in the struct and updates the return size accordingly.
