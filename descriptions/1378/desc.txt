// This function decodes a single frame from a CDXL video packet. It first 
// extracts video encoding parameters from the packet data, including 
// width, height, bits per pixel (bpp), and format type. It then verifies 
// the validity of these parameters, ensuring they conform to expected 
// constraints, such as palette size and bit depth. Based on the encoding 
// and format, it sets the pixel format and prepares the buffer for 
// decoding. Depending on the encoding type, it calls appropriate helper 
// functions to decode the video data into either RGB, raw, or HAM (Hold 
// And Modify) formats. Finally, it updates the frame as a complete one, 
// returning the size of the processed buffer or an error code if any 
// issue arises during decoding.
