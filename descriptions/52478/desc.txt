// Iterate over animation envelopes and process pre and post behavior settings. 
// This involves handling different behavior types such as OffsetRepeat, Repeat, and Oscillate.
// For pre behavior, if the behavior type matches, it calculates the starting time,
// creates new keys, adjusts the existing keys, and updates the time values according
// to the specified behavior.
// The post behavior is prepared to handle similar behavior types but currently lacks
// implementation details beyond suppressing compiler warnings.
// This section does not handle reset, linear, or constant pre/post behaviors; these are
// managed elsewhere in the code.
