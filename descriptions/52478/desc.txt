// Iterates over a list of envelopes and processes their pre and post behaviors for animation keyframes.
// For each envelope, it calculates the time delta between the first and last keyframe and adjusts
// the keyframes according to the specified pre behavior (OffsetRepeat, Repeat, Oscillate).
// Handles keyframe duplication and time adjustment to support repeated or oscillated animation sequences.
// The post behavior handling is initialized but not yet implemented, leaving room for future extension.
