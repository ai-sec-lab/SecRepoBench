// This part implements the detection of Spotify UDP packets based on specific port and payload content.
// It checks if both the source and destination ports match the designated Spotify port (57621).
// If so, it verifies whether the payload length is sufficient and matches the expected Spotify UDP identifier "SpotUdp".
// Upon a successful match, it logs the detection and adds the connection to the identified Spotify connections.
