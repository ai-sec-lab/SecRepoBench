// Check if the UDP packet is coming from and going to a specific port associated with Spotify.
// If the packet's payload length is sufficient, compare the beginning of the payload to
// the string "SpotUdp". If a match is found, log that a Spotify UDP packet was detected,
// update the connection information to mark the flow as Spotify-related, and exit the function.
