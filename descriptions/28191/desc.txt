// Computes a hash value for an IEEE 1905 fragment key.
// The key consists of source and destination MAC addresses, a fragment ID, and a VLAN ID.
// The function first checks the validity of the key and its address data.
// A buffer is declared and filled with the source and destination MAC addresses,
// the fragment ID, and the VLAN ID. A strong hash function is then used to compute
// a hash value from the buffer, which is returned as the result.
