// This function handles the opening of a specific disk within a multi-disk ZIP archive.
// It takes a stream of the current ZIP file, the disk number to open, and the mode of operation.
// A new filename is generated by modifying the current filename to reflect the disk number.
// The filename is modified by replacing the file extension with a ".zXX" format, where XX is the disk number.
// Memory is dynamically allocated for the new filename and is freed after use.
// The function returns a pointer to the opened file stream if successful, or NULL otherwise.
