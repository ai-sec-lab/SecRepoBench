// Iterate over the buffer, reading chunks of data.
// For each chunk, read the chunk identifier and its size.
// If the size is invalid or not enough bytes remain in the buffer, return 0.
// Adjust the size to exclude the header and switch based on chunk type:
// - For 'CTRL' chunks, perform no action.
// - For 'SNDS' chunks, check for minimal size and 'SHDR' marker. 
//   Validate sample rate and channels; if valid, return maximum probe score.
// - For 'SHDR' chunks, skip a predefined number of bytes if the size is large enough.
// Skip the current chunk's data and proceed to the next chunk.
