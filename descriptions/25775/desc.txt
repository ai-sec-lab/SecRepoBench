// This section implements the probing logic for the 3DO STR format. It iterates
// over the buffer using the index `bufferIndex` to examine chunks of data. Each
// chunk is identified by a 32-bit tag (e.g., 'CTRL', 'SNDS', 'SHDR') and a size.
// The code checks if the size is sufficient and whether the buffer has enough
// data remaining. For 'SNDS' chunks, it verifies the presence of a 'SHDR' tag
// and checks the codec ID. If a recognized 'SDX2' codec is found, it returns a
// maximum probe score indicating a match. The loop continues until a condition
// fails or the buffer ends.
