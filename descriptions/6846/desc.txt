// Calculate the number of vertices in the input primitive information array
// by iterating through it until an undefined primitive is encountered.
// Allocate memory for a polygon array based on the calculated number of vertices.
// If memory allocation fails, return false to indicate an error.
// Clone the draw information from the input to create a working copy
// that will be used in subsequent operations within the function.
