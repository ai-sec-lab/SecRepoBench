// This part processes each metalayer in a trailer by extracting metadata such as
// the name and content for each layer. It first checks if the trailer position is within
// bounds and performs a sanity check on the metalayer marker. It reads the metalayer
// name length, allocates memory for the name, and populates it. Then, it retrieves the
// offset to the serialized content, verifies it is within bounds, and accesses the content
// marker. It finally reads the content size and allocates memory for the content,
// copying it into the allocated space. This sequence repeats for all metalayers present
// in the trailer.
