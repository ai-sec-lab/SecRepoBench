// This code block processes characters from an input stream to read a string literal.
// It continues reading and appending characters to the string until it encounters
// a newline (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), or (optionally) a null character (`0`).
// If none of these conditions are met, the current character is appended to the
// string, and the next character in the stream is read.
