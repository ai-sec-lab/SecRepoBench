// Reads a string literal from the input stream. The string is enclosed by 
// single or double quotes, which is specified by 'sng'. The function starts 
// by clearing any existing content in 'parserContext->str', and then reads 
// characters one-by-one using NextCh() until the closing quote (matching 'sng') 
// or a newline is encountered. Each character is appended to 'parserContext->str'. 
// Once the closing quote is found or the loop exits on encountering a newline, 
// the 'parserContext->sy' is set to SSTRING, and the input is advanced to 
// the next character.
