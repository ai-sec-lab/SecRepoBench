// This function implements a function that evaluates a mathematical 
// expression recursively for image processing. It handles operators 
// and functions, while managing operator precedence and associativity.
// The expression is parsed and evaluated based on a predefined set of 
// operations and mathematical functions, including trigonometric, 
// logarithmic, and other common mathematical operations. It supports 
// both infix operators and unary operations. The function checks for 
// errors like unbalanced parentheses, deep nesting, and invalid syntax.
// The results of the evaluation are used for pixel manipulation tasks.
