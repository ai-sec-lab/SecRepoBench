// Handle unary operations and functions on expressions.
// First, check for expressions enclosed in parentheses and evaluate them recursively.
// Then, examine the first character of the expression to determine if it is a
// unary operator or a supported function. Based on the identified operator or
// function, evaluate the corresponding subexpression recursively or perform the
// relevant mathematical operation. For functions, ensure the correct number of
// characters are matched to recognize the specific function. Finally, handle
// predefined symbols or interpret numerical values directly from the expression
// when applicable. Return the evaluated result of the expression.
