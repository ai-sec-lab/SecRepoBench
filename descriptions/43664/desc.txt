// Process and parse the "supported versions" extension during TLS handshake.
// This extension contains the list of supported TLS versions by the client.
// If the extension is identified, extract the versions and format them into
// a human-readable string, and also convert them into a format suitable
// for further processing, such as JA3 computation.
// Additionally, handle specific extensions like encrypted server name and
// QUIC transport parameters for further inspection and processing.
