// If the extension ID corresponds to "encrypted server name" (ESNI), process this extension
// by extracting the cipher suite and ESNI data from the packet payload. Update the flow
// structure with the cipher suite information. Allocate memory and store the ESNI data
// as a hexadecimal string in the flow structure if it has not been set already. This is
// part of the TLS extension handling to support encrypted SNI, which helps in maintaining
// privacy by hiding the actual server name being accessed.
