// Handle parsing of quoted strings, ensuring the entire quoted segment is captured.
// Support escape sequences within the quotes, converting them to their appropriate character representations.
// If no escape sequences are found, copy the quoted string directly.
// Create a new plist node with the parsed string data, update the `plist` pointer, and skip any trailing whitespace.
