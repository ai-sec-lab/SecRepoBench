// Normalize the given URI path by removing redundant "." and ".." path segments.
// This function creates a copy of the URI, checks if it ends with a slash, 
// and splits the URI based on the '/' delimiter into components. It then iterates
// over these components, discarding "." segments and resolving ".." segments
// by removing the preceding component. The resulting components are then
// concatenated back into a normalized path. A final slash is appended if 
// the original URI ended with one. The function returns the normalized path.
