// LocaleLowercase and LocaleUppercase functions handle character case conversion.
// Check if the input character is EOF before converting. In Snippet 1, 
// if the character is EOF, it is returned as is, without conversion. 
// Snippet 2 adds an additional check to ensure the character fits into an 
// unsigned char, returning the original character if not. 
// This ensures special or non-standard values are handled properly.
