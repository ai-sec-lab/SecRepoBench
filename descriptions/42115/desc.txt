// Extract the dNSName or IP address from the packet payload based on the general_name_type.
// Convert the extracted IP address to a string format if applicable.
// Clean up the server name for any extraneous characters.
// Compare the extracted server name or IP address with the host server name from the flow
// to check for a match. If no host server name is available, assume a match.
// Store the extracted server name in the flow's server_names field, appending it
// if there are existing names, and update the server_names_len.
// Check if the extracted server name matches a known protocol using a hostname matching function,
// and update the subprotocol_detected flag accordingly.
