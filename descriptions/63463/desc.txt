// This code block verifies and adjusts the size of a DWG object by comparing
// the expected end position with the current position in the data stream.
// For pre-R11 versions, it corrects the byte position if there's a mismatch
// and stores any unknown trailing data. For later versions, it also performs
// CRC checks. If the calculated size exceeds available data, it logs an error
// and corrects the size. It handles unknown trailing data by storing it in the
// object and logs any discrepancies found during the parsing process.
