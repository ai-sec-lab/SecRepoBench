// This part checks the size of an entity in a DWG file and ensures it matches the expected size. 
// For versions pre-R_2_0, entities do not contain size information, so no size check is performed. 
// For versions later than R_2_0, a check is performed to ensure that the entity's size matches the 
// data's expected length. If a discrepancy is found, it logs an error and, if necessary, reads any 
// extra unknown data as a bit field. In versions from R_11 onwards, the code also validates the 
// CRC16 checksum at the end of the entity's data. If the CRC check fails, it marks an error. 
// Memory is allocated for unknown remaining data if present, and this data is logged for inspection.
