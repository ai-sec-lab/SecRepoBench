// This part handles different data types for CDF properties during extraction.
// It uses a switch case statement to determine the type of the property and
// then performs the corresponding operation for each type.
// - For types like CDF_SIGNED16, CDF_SIGNED32, and CDF_SIGNED64, it copies
//   the property value using cdf_copy_info, which checks size constraints.
// - For string types (CDF_LENGTH32_STRING and CDF_LENGTH32_WSTRING), it handles
//   multiple elements by adjusting memory allocation and iterating through
//   the elements to copy each string into the property info structure.
// - If the property type is not recognized, it logs a debug message indicating
//   an unknown type and proceeds without processing the unknown data.
