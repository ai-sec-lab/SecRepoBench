// Set the quantum depth based on the provided depth, ensuring it doesn't exceed 64.
// Adjust the depth for floating point format if necessary.
// Calculate the quantum size based on the number of pixel channels and pad value,
// considering the quantum depth and image dimensions.
// Ensure memory allocation for quantum pixels, releasing existing memory if needed.
// Acquire new quantum pixels if the current allocation is insufficient.
