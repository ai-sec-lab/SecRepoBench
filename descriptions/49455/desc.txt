// Calculate the total number of nodes in an n-dimensional hypercube, where each dimension
// has a specified number of nodes. The function iterates over the dimensions, multiplying
// the running total by the number of nodes in each dimension. It checks for overflow
// and returns 0 in case of an error or overflow. The difference in snippets lies in the 
// condition for error checking based on the number of nodes in a dimension.
