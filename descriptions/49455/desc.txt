// This section of code calculates the total number of nodes in a multidimensional cube,
// represented by the array Dims. For each dimension, it checks for errors. The result is the product
// of the sizes of all dimensions, and the function ensures no overflow occurs during this
// computation by returning 0 in case of errors or overflow.
