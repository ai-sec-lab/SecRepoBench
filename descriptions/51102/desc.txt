// Initialize the SuggestMgr with parameters for suggestion management.
// Register the given AffixMgr pointer, initialize character conversion
// and suggestion parameters such as utf8 support, language number,
// and complex prefix handling based on AffixMgr settings. Determine
// character key and try lengths, and populate the corresponding 
// character arrays, considering UTF-8 encoding if applicable. Set 
// limits for suggestions, including maximum n-gram and compound 
// suggestions, and determine if the language potentially allows
// dash usage in suggestions based on the presence of '-' or 'a' 
// in the TRY characters.
