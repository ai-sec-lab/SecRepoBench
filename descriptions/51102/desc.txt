// Convert the character key string (ckey) and the try string (tryme) into
// their respective internal representations, handling both UTF-8 and
// non-UTF-8 encoding scenarios. If UTF-8 encoding is involved, calculate
// the length of the converted UTF-16 strings and store it in ckeyl and
// ctryl, respectively. Otherwise, store the size of the original strings
// in these variables. This conversion is essential for accurate processing
// of the strings in the context of the suggestion manager, considering
// the encoding requirements.
