// Check if the dataset is marked as sparse and, if so, read the number of rows
// and adjust the dimensions and class type of the matvar accordingly. Additionally,
// check if the dataset is compound to determine if it is complex. If the variable
// is not sparse, verify if it is a structure and read the field names from the
// MATLAB_fields attribute if it exists. If the attribute doesn't exist, iterate
// through the group links to determine the number and names of fields. Update the
// matvar with the field information obtained.
