// This part converts a source string from a specified codepage to UTF-8.
// It initializes variables to determine if the codepage is Asian and calculates
// the source and destination string lengths accordingly. It allocates memory 
// for the destination UTF-8 string, and iterates over the source text, 
// performing UTF-8 encoding. For Asian codepages, it handles multi-byte 
// characters and uses the `dwg_codepage_uwc` function for conversion. If a 
// character is not an ASCII or is representable as a Unicode character, it is 
// encoded in UTF-8 format. The `EXTEND_SIZE` macro is used to ensure enough 
// memory is available. Finally, the encoded UTF-8 string is returned, passing 
// it through the `bit_u_expand` function to handle any Unicode sequences.
