// This function reads the field names from a MATLAB structure stored in an HDF5 file.
// It opens the "MATLAB_fields" attribute of the given dataset, retrieves the number
// of fields, and allocates memory to store the field names. It reads the field names
// into a variable-length array and then copies them to the matvar_handle structure.
// The function handles errors related to memory allocation and HDF5 operations, and
// uses the appropriate function to reclaim variable-length memory based on the HDF5
// version. It returns an error code indicating success or failure of the operation.
