// Optimizes swizzle expressions applied to constructors by simplifying them into 
// a more efficient representation if possible. When the swizzle components are 
// all simple `xyzw`, the function checks if any arguments in the constructor 
// can be reordered or collapsed, while ensuring that expressions with side 
// effects are only used once and non-trivial expressions are not duplicated. 
// If optimization is possible, the swizzle is simplified into a new constructor 
// expression with reordered arguments and potential inner swizzles. If a scalar 
// is swizzled, it creates a simplified constructor of scalar size. The function 
// updates the usage of expressions and marks the context for rescanning if needed.
