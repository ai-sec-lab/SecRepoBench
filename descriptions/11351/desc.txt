// Iterate over the initial set of glyph IDs to retain and for each glyph ID,
// add the glyph and its composite children to a comprehensive set of glyphs
// to retain, taking into account the referenced composite glyphs. Clean up
// the initial set after processing. Allocate space in the glyph vector for
// all the retained glyph IDs, and prepare for iterating over them.
