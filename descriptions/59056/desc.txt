// The code checks if the current token is `nullptr`, which indicates the end of the file. 
// If it's a top-level scope, the current element is inserted into the `elements` map and the function returns. 
// If it's not a top-level scope, the element is deleted, and a parse error is thrown due to the unexpected end of file. 
// If the token is not `nullptr`, the element is inserted into the `elements` map.
