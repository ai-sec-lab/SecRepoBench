// Check if the parsing is at the top-level scope. If so, insert the current element into the
// element map and return. If not, delete the current element and signal a parse error indicating 
// an unexpected end of file. The handling of deletion may vary slightly between the snippets, 
// using either a direct `delete` call or a `delete_Element` utility function.
