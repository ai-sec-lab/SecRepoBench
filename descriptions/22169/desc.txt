// If the next two bytes in the payload form another CR+NL ("\r\n") sequence,
// indicating the end of HTTP headers, calculate the number of bytes remaining
// in the payload after the double CR+NL. Copy these bytes into the `initial_binary_bytes`
// buffer of the `flow` structure, up to the maximum size of this buffer, and
// update the length of bytes copied. This process is part of parsing the HTTP
// headers and storing additional data for further processing or analysis.
