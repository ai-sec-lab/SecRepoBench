// Extend the memory allocated for op1_string to accommodate the concatenated result, ensuring
// that any necessary cleanup is done to prevent freeing the result prematurely. This involves
// handling special cases where the strings being concatenated are the same, to avoid errors
// related to memory reallocation. The extended string is prepared to store the concatenated
// result, and any prior reference to the result is properly destructed if needed.
