// Retrieve a lazy chunk from a frame, given a chunk index. The function first
// checks the header for frame information and validates the chunk index. It
// then retrieves the offset for the specified chunk. If the chunk is special
// (indicated by a negative offset), it creates a special chunk using
// `frame_special_chunk`. If the frame is disk-based, it reads the chunk data
// from the file and constructs a lazy chunk with block sizes for decompression
// later. If the frame is in memory, it simply returns a pointer to the chunk
// in memory. The function ensures the correct chunk size is returned, and if
// any errors occur during processing, it cleans up any allocated resources.
