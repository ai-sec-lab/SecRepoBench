// Close the file pointer if it was opened. Check the return code (`rc`) to determine
// if an error occurred. If an error is detected and a dynamically allocated chunk needs
// to be freed, release the memory and set the chunk pointer to NULL. Finally, return
// the size of the lazy chunk (lazychunk_cbytes) as the function's result.
