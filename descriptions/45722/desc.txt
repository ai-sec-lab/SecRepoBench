// The function `vp9_superframe_filter` processes VP9 video packets to handle
// invisible frames and constructs a superframe if needed. Initially, it
// retrieves a packet reference. It checks if the packet uses superframe
// syntax by examining the marker byte. Using `GetBitContext`, the function
// extracts frame marker and profile information to determine if the frame is
// invisible. It handles different scenarios: if mixing of superframe and
// naked frames is detected, an error is logged. For visible frames or when
// superframe syntax is used with an empty cache, the packet is passed through
// unchanged. Invisible frames are cached, and if the cache is full, an error
// is reported. When a visible frame follows cached invisible ones, a superframe
// is constructed using `merge_superframe`. If successful, packet properties are
// copied from the last cached packet, and cache entries are cleared.
