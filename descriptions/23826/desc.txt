// Acquire a global mutex lock to ensure thread safety for the decompression operation.
// Perform the decompression using a global context, applying the source data to the
// destination buffer. The source and destination sizes are used as parameters to define
// the bounds of the decompression process. Release the mutex lock after the operation
// is complete, and return the result of the decompression.
