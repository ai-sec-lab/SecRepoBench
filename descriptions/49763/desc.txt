// This code block implements the long division algorithm for multi-precision
// integers using the Knuth's Algorithm D for division of two unsigned integers.
// It calculates the quotient and remainder when dividing 'xx' by 'yy'.
// The algorithm iterates from the most significant digit to the least, estimating
// each quotient digit. If the estimated quotient digit is too large, it corrects
// it by subtracting. The loop updates 'x' with the adjusted values and assigns
// the calculated quotient digit to 'q'. The process repeats until all digits
// are processed, ensuring correct division with multi-precision arithmetic.
