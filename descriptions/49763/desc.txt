// Implements the division algorithm for multi-precision integers.
// This code calculates the quotient and remainder of two large numbers.
// The process involves estimating a digit of the quotient, adjusting the
// remainder, and repeating until all digits are processed.
// `qhat` is an estimated quotient digit, computed using the most significant
// digits of the current remainder and the divisor.
// Adjustments are made to ensure the estimated `qhat` is correct, and the
// remainder is updated accordingly.
// If `qhat` overestimates, the remainder is corrected by adding back the
// divisor. Each calculated quotient digit is stored in `q`.
// This logic iterates over all relevant digits of the dividend.
