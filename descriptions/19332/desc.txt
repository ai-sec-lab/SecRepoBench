// Loop through the payload to parse STUN message attributes. For each attribute,
// determine its type and length, and align it to a multiple of 4 bytes. Depending
// on the attribute type, set the guessed host protocol ID to identify the potential
// application or service (e.g., Zoom, WhatsApp Call, Skype Call) and return that
// the packet is STUN if a known attribute is found. If certain known conditions
// regarding the attributes or host server names are met, update the host protocol
// ID accordingly and determine if the flow is STUN. Continue the process until
// all attributes are checked or a conclusive identification is made, at which
// point the flow proceeds to a label indicating a STUN packet has been found.
