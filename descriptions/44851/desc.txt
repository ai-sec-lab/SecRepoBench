// Calculate the winding number for a given point (x_coordinate, y) with
// respect to a polygon edge defined by a segment of points. The code checks
// if the point is inside the polygon by iterating through the edges of the
// polygon and updating the winding number based on the edge's direction and
// the position of the point relative to the edge.
