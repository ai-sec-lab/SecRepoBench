// Check if the x-coordinate is greater than the current edge's x2 bound;
// if so, update the winding number based on the edge's direction and skip to the next edge.
// Otherwise, iterate through the edge's points to find the segment where the y-coordinate
// falls within the current segment's bounds, setting the pointer q to the appropriate point.
