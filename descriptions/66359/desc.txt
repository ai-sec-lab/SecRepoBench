// The masked code block performs a check for the presence of the string "DivX" 
// within a given frame buffer starting at a certain offset. If the string 
// "DivX" is not found at the specified position (offset plus 4), the code 
// advances the index 'i' by 4 bytes and continues the loop. This is used to
// determine if the header contains a "DivX" marker for packed DivX bitstreams,
// which might require special handling or unpacking.
