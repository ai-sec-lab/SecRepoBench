// Handle escaped characters in a JSON string. If a backslash is detected,
// check the subsequent character to determine the type of escape sequence.
// Common escape sequences like \" (quote), \\ (backslash), \/ (slash),
// \b (backspace), \f (form feed), \n (new line), \r (carriage return),
// and \t (tab) are supported. The \u escape sequence expects four hexadecimal
// digits, which are validated using json_isxdigit. If an invalid escape
// sequence or a premature end of data is detected, exit the string parsing.
