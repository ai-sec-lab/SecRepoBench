// This function reads the ".debug" section from the given BFD handle.
// It first checks if the section is available, setting an error if not.
// It saves the current file position, seeks to the section's start,
// reads the entire section into memory, and then restores the file position.
// The read section data is returned if successful.
// The caller receives the section information through the sect_return parameter.
