// Analyze the payload of the current packet to attempt to identify it as part of an OpenVPN protocol.
// First, check if the payload length meets a minimum threshold. If the packet is TCP, adjust the payload pointer.
// Extract the opcode from the payload and if the packet is UDP, check specific conditions on the opcode and payload length
// to determine if it matches known OpenVPN patterns. If a match is found, log the detection and update the protocol info.
// For certain opcodes, verify and store session-related information and check for key mismatches in subsequent packets.
// Maintain a counter to track attempts to establish or confirm a session. If a key mismatch occurs, or if the payload
// does not match OpenVPN criteria, exclude the OpenVPN protocol for this flow.
