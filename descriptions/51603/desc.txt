// This function parses a "STRENGTH" annotation line from a magic file and
// applies it to the magic entry 'me'. It extracts a factor operation and a
// factor value from the input string, and sets them in the magic entry.
// The operation can be one of: none, plus, minus, times, or divide.
// If the factor value is invalid (e.g., too large or invalid characters),
// or if it conflicts with the operation (e.g., division by zero), a warning
// is emitted and an error is returned. The function checks if a strength
// type has already been set and issues a warning if so. It also checks that
// the entry is not a "name" type, as this setting is not supported for such
// entries. The input string is expected to contain an operation character
// followed by a numeric factor. The function returns 0 on success and -1 on
// failure.
