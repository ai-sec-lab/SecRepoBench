// Calculate the starting horizontal position (destX) for placing decoded
// pixel data in the output image. This is done by determining the number
// of full image heights worth of lines processed so far (using
// processedLineSlices and mRaw->dim.y), multiplying by the width of a
// single slice and dividing by the number of color planes per pixel (mRaw->getCpp()).
// This calculation helps in handling multi-slice and multi-line decoding.
