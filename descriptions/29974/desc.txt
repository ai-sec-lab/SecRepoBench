// Increment the count of SACK ranges and store the left and right edges of the current SACK
// block for further analysis. This is done only if sequence analysis is enabled and
// forward direction TCP analysis information is available and tracking of bytes in flight
// is enabled. These stored blocks are used for analyzing bytes in flight (BiF).
