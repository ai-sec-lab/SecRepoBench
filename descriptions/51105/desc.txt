// Parse the input line to extract phonetic table settings, ensuring there
// are exactly two entries parsed from the line. Initialize a phonetable
// structure based on the extracted data, including the number of subsequent
// lines to read. For each specified number of lines, parse phonetic rules
// and add them to the phonetable's rules list, verifying the integrity of
// each entry. Once all rules are correctly parsed and added, update the
// phonetable and initialize its hash for efficient access.
