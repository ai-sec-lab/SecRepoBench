// Handle the case where the floating point number is less than 1.0
      // and requires conversion using fixed-point format ('f').
      // The first digit is set and precision is adjusted based on buffer size.
      // If the original format is 'g', adjust precision to account for the exponent.
      // Ensure that precision does not exceed buffer capacity to prevent overflow.
      // Add a decimal point if there are digits to follow or if the alternate form is specified.
      // Populate leading zeros if the exponent is negative, i.e., the number is less than 1.
