// Advance the index 'x' by the length of the current DNS name, obtained using
// a function that calculates the name length from the packet payload. If the
// name length is zero, terminate the process. Then, ensure there is sufficient
// remaining space in the packet to read a 16-bit response type value.
// If so, extract the response type from the packet payload at the current index.
