// Extracts and processes DNS answer records from the packet payload.
// Iterates through DNS answer records, extracting the response type,
// TTL (time-to-live), and data length. Updates the flow's DNS response
// type and address if the response type is A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6).
// Logs suspicious DNS records with zero TTL. Checks for obsolete
// or suspicious DNS types using ndpi_check_dns_type. Handles potential
// truncation and misalignment by checking bounds before accessing data.
