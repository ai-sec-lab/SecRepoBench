// This part processes metalayers within a frame header. For each metalayer:
// 1. It checks the validity of the msgpack format and initializes a new metalayer structure.
// 2. Extracts the metalayer name length, then reads and stores the name.
// 3. Retrieves the offset to the serialized content of the metalayer.
// 4. Validates and reads the content marker to ensure correct msgpack format.
// 5. Reads the size of the serialized content, verifies it, and finally stores the content itself.
