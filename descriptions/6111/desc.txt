// The function reads a Postscript image file and returns the image. 
// It opens the image file, sets the page density based on resolution, 
// and initializes necessary variables for processing. 
// It parses document structuring comments from the Postscript file 
// to determine properties like bounding box, ICC profiles, and CMYK colors. 
// It creates a Ghostscript control file to render the Postscript image 
// using an appropriate Ghostscript delegate. 
// The rendered image(s) are read back into memory, with optional handling 
// for multiple scenes/pages. Image properties and profiles are copied from 
// the original image to the rendered one, and the final image list is returned.
