// This code block is responsible for reading a Postscript (PS) image file
// and returning an Image object. It initializes and opens the image file,
// sets up various parameters such as density and resolution, and processes
// document structuring comments to determine properties like bounding box
// and whether the document is CMYK. The code also handles ICC, Photoshop,
// and XMP profiles. After parsing, it invokes a delegate (likely Ghostscript)
// to render the Postscript content to an image. It then reads the resulting
// images, processes any profiles, and consolidates CMYK images if necessary.
// Finally, it returns the processed images, with properties and profiles
// cloned from the input image.
