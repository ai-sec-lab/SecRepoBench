// Reads and validates the ICC profile header from the IO handler, ensuring the magic number matches
// the expected value. Adjusts the endianness of key profile parameters like device class, color space,
// rendering intent, and more. Determines the profile's header size and ensures it does not exceed the
// reported size. Decodes the profile's creation date and profile ID. Reads the tag directory and performs
// sanity checks on each tag's offset and size to ensure they fall within valid file boundaries. It also
// identifies linked tags by checking for tags with identical offsets and sizes and updates the tag
// count accordingly. Returns TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
