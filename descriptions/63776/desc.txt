// This part checks and adjusts the object size and byte position for DWG entities.
// For versions before R11, it verifies if the object size exceeds the data size limit,
// and adjusts the size if necessary. It also copies unknown data if there is a size mismatch.
// For later versions, it performs similar checks, but also verifies CRC values.
// If the object size exceeds the allowable data size, it logs an error and recalculates the size.
// Unknown data is copied in both cases if the calculated offset is greater than the current byte position.
// Finally, the data byte position is adjusted based on the object's size and starting position.
