// Check if the current attribute is an ID or a reference in the document context.
// If it is an ID, remove it from the document's ID table to maintain consistency.
// Optionally, if it is a reference, remove it from the document's reference table as well.
// This ensures that removing the attribute does not leave any invalid references or IDs
// in the document structure, preventing potential inconsistencies.
