// Determine whether the numeric string represents an integer or a floating-point number.
// If it is an integer, create a new plist node representing an unsigned integer.
// If it is a floating-point number, parse both the fractional and exponential parts
// to compute the floating-point value, then create a new plist node representing
// this real number. Handle invalid characters appropriately and log errors if
// encountered during parsing.
