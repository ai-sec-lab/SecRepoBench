// Removes the "file://" scheme from a file URL to convert it to a file system path.
// If the URL is in the format "file:///C:..." (common in Windows), 
// it removes the first 8 characters to maintain the drive letter (e.g., "C:\").
// Otherwise, it removes the first 7 characters for URLs like "file:///home/user" (common in Unix),
// effectively stripping the "file://" prefix.
