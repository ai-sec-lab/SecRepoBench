// Allocate memory for the `graphic_context` array to store draw information, ensuring that the allocation is successful.
// Then, allocate memory for the `primitive_info` array to store details about graphic primitives, initializing `number_points` to a predetermined size.
// If memory allocation for either the `graphic_context` or `primitive_info` fails, clean up any allocated resources and throw a resource limit exception, indicating a memory allocation error associated with the image filename.
