// Reference the 'glyf' table associated with the font face and determine the number
// of glyphs by calculating it from the length of the 'loca' table, adjusting based
// on whether the offset is short or long. Adjust the number of glyphs to ensure it
// does not exceed the total number of glyphs provided by the font face.
