// This code implements a substring search function that utilizes bitwise operations 
// for efficiency. It defines bit masks and uses a loop to iterate over possible 
// starting points in the larger string `ys` where the substring `xs` might be found.
// The function checks for possible matches by comparing the first and last characters
// of the substring using bitwise operations. If a potential match is found, it uses 
// `memcmp` to verify the substring match. Different implementations are provided for 
// 32-bit and 64-bit systems, with additional consideration for endianness. The function
// returns the starting index of the match or -1 if no match is found.
