// This part compares prefix information from two different sources
// to determine if there are any updates. It starts by finding the base prefix
// (prefixBase) using the given prefix and its length. If the base prefix is 
// not found, it exits early indicating an update. If a border router is present,
// it attempts to find the base border router (borderRouterBase) for the same prefix.
// It checks if the base border router is found and compares its content with the
// current border router. Any mismatch in content or presence indicates an update.
// The same process is applied to the hasRoute TLV, finding a corresponding 
// base has route (hasRouteBase) and comparing it with the current hasRoute.
// Any discrepancies imply that there has been an update.
