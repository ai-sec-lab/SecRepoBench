// Check if the version is EXPERIMENTAL_LINE_TABLES_VERSION.
// Verify that the line pointer matches the expected sequence of bytes for this version.
// Read the logicals_table_offset and actuals_table_offset from the data.
// Store these offsets in the line_context.
// Update the line pointer to account for the read offsets.
// Ensure that the line pointer does not exceed the line pointer end after the updates.
