// Allocate memory for the `tiff_pixels` buffer. The allocation size is 
// determined as the maximum of either the TIFF scanline size or a calculated 
// size based on the image dimensions, number of samples per pixel, and 
// bits per sample. The size calculation involves using the logarithm 
// to determine the necessary buffer size for the image data.
