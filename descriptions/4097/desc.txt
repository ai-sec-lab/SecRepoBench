// Processes a DeleteSubscriptionsRequest from a client session by logging the request
// and then calling UA_Server_processServiceOperations to delete subscriptions based
// on the provided subscription IDs. After processing, it checks if the session still 
// has any remaining subscriptions. If no subscriptions remain in the session, 
// it ensures any pending publish responses are handled appropriately. This is done by 
// sending the remaining publish responses when the last subscription has been removed.
