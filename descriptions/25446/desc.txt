// Check if the cname string ends with a '$' character. If it does, remove
// the '$' and store the cname as a hostname in the flow structure. If not,
// store the cname as a username. Then, iterate over the payload data to
// locate the realm offset using ASN.1 encoding markers. Adjust the realm
// offset and extract the realm string. Convert the realm string to lowercase
// and store it as a domain in the flow structure. Ensure that the process
// respects the payload length constraints and properly handles string
// operations.
