// Iterate through a list of MeshCoP TLVs to process each one based on its type.
// The loop checks the current TLV pointer and ensures it does not exceed the
// end boundary. It processes TLVs of type `kJoinerUdpPort` and `kSteeringData`
// to set a flag indicating a valid TLV was found. For `kCommissionerSessionId`,
// it validates the TLV and extracts the session ID if valid, marking that
// a session ID was found. If the TLV is of type `kBorderAgentLocator`, the loop
// exits immediately. Unknown or unexpected TLVs are ignored, allowing the loop
// to continue processing the next TLV in sequence.
