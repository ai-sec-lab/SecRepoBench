// This code block performs motion compensation for a single macroblock
// in low resolution mode. It handles different types of motion vectors:
// - MV_TYPE_16X16: Applies a single motion vector for the entire 16x16
//   macroblock.
// - MV_TYPE_8X8: Uses four separate 8x8 motion vectors. It calculates
//   the average motion vector to handle chroma components.
// - MV_TYPE_FIELD: Handles field-based motion vectors, applying separate
//   motion vectors for top and bottom fields if the picture structure is
//   a frame.
// - MV_TYPE_16X8: Two half-macroblock motion vectors are applied to each
//   16x8 region.
// - MV_TYPE_DMV: Dual-prime motion vectors for frames or fields, using
//   averaging for the second field if necessary.
// The motion vectors are read from the context structure 's', and the
// chroma motion is optionally calculated if CONFIG_GRAY is not set or
// the codec is not in grayscale mode. Each case extracts the appropriate
// motion vectors and calls functions for applying motion compensation.
