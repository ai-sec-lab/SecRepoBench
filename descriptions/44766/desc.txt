// Parse an ESDS box contained within unknown data.
// Create a bitstream reader (mybs) for the remaining unknown data.
// Use a cookie to disable logging during parsing operations.
// If an ESDS box already exists, remove it from the child boxes list and from any nested child lists.
// Parse an ESDS box from the bitstream, replacing the existing one if successful.
// If parsing is successful, add the ESDS box to the child boxes list.
// Clean up and delete the bitstream reader.
