// Decodes the header of a CRAM slice block, which contains metadata
// about the slice such as reference sequence ID, start position, 
// span, number of records, and content IDs. It first checks if the 
// block is compressed and decompresses it if necessary. The function
// allocates memory for the slice header structure and populates it
// by parsing the data from the block. It returns the populated
// slice header on success and handles errors by freeing allocated
// resources and returning NULL.
