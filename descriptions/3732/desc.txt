// This part is a template function `decodeN_X_Y` for the CR2 
// decompressor, handling the decoding of pixel data based on the number 
// of components (N_COMP) and the sampling factors (X_S_F, Y_S_F).
// It initializes Huffman tables and predictors, and manages the 
// bit stream from the input. It accounts for specific image formats 
// like Canon's sRaw and mRaw formats, handling various frame 
// configurations and slice widths. The function iterates through 
// image slices, decoding pixel groups while adjusting predictors 
// and updating pixel data. It includes special fixes for known 
// Canon image format quirks. The function utilizes 
// loop unrolling for performance during pixel decoding.
