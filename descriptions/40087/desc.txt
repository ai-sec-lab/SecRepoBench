// Validate that there is enough room in the packet buffer for necessary decryption operations,
// including the payload length, packet number, and authentication tag. If the packet is too
// short, reset the ciphers and return NULL. Otherwise, decrypt the packet header to extract
// the first byte and packet number, which are used to adjust offsets. Perform message
// decryption using the prepared ciphers, and check if decryption was successful by verifying
// the data length. If successful, set the clear payload length to the decrypted data length
// and return the decrypted data. If decryption fails, reset the ciphers and return NULL.
