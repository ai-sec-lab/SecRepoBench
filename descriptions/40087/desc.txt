// Function to decrypt the initial QUIC packet payload using the derived client
// initial secret. The function sets up the necessary ciphers and decrypts
// the packet to obtain the clear payload. It starts by deriving the initial
// secrets from the destination connection ID and initializes the ciphers for
// packet protection and header protection. Then, it calculates the packet
// number offset and decrypts the packet header to obtain the packet number.
// Finally, it decrypts the payload using the packet protection cipher and
// returns the decrypted data if successful.
