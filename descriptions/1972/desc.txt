// Traverse the structure of an XML element's content, which can be of various
// types (e.g., PCDATA, ELEMENT, SEQ, OR). For each type, append its textual
// representation to the provided buffer 'buf'. When dealing with ELEMENT type,
// handle the optional prefix if present, and concatenate the complete QName.
// For SEQ and OR types, recursively process their child elements and append
// separators ("," for SEQ and "|" for OR) between them, while considering
// whether parentheses should encompass the content based on the 'englob' flag.
// Finally, append occurrence indicators ("?", "*", "+") as appropriate,
// reflecting how many times an element can appear. The function also manages
// buffer space constraints by limiting additions if there's insufficient space
// in 'buf', and truncating with " ..." where necessary.
