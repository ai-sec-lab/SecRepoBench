// This part retrieves various metadata and internal details from a frame object
// to populate the provided output parameters. It first checks if the frame is in memory
// or needs to be read from disk, then ensures the frame type is consistent with its
// expected structure (directory type for sparse frames and contiguous type for standard
// frames). It retrieves and checks several lengths and sizes from the frame header, 
// including the header length, frame length, uncompressed size, compressed size, 
// block size, chunk size, and type size, performing error handling for invalid values.
// Codec and filter information is also extracted and validated, and the number of chunks
// is computed from the uncompressed size and chunk size if valid data is present.
