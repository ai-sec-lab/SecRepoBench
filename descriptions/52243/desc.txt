// This function interprets and prints the contents of the .pdata section 
// of a PE (Portable Executable) file, which contains information about 
// the function table entries used for exception handling on certain 
// architectures (such as ARM or SH4). The function first checks if the 
// .pdata section is present and valid. If valid, it reads the section's 
// contents, iterating over each function entry. Each entry consists of 
// the beginning address of the function, the lengths of its prolog and 
// function, along with flags indicating whether the entry uses 32-bit 
// exception handling and whether it has an associated exception handler. 
// For entries with an exception handler, additional information is retrieved 
// from the .text section. The function then prints this data in a formatted 
// manner, including the function name if available. After processing all 
// entries, it frees any allocated memory and returns. Any anomalies in 
// the section, are warned about.
