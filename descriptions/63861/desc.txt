// This code reads a text description type from a profile, which can be either a simple ASCII string or a complex multi-localized Unicode string.
// It begins by reading the ASCII string length and ensuring sufficient tag size.
// Then, it allocates memory for the ASCII string, reads it from the input stream, and appends a null terminator.
// The ASCII text is set in a multi-localized Unicode (MLU) structure.
// If additional Unicode or script code data follows, it processes those in a similar manner, updating the MLU.
// It ensures proper memory management by freeing allocated memory in case of errors or when done.
