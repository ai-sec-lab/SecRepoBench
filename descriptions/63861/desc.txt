// This function reads a textDescriptionType structure from an ICC profile. The structure includes
// ASCII and Unicode text, and ScriptCode values. The function allocates memory for the text,
// reads it from the input handler, and then stores it in a multi-locale Unicode (mlu) container.
// It first reads an ASCII text string length, then reads the ASCII string itself. After that, it
// attempts to read and store a Unicode string if present. Finally, it skips over any ScriptCode
// data, often found in some buggy profiles. The function returns a pointer to the mlu container,
// or NULL if any read operation fails or memory allocation fails.
