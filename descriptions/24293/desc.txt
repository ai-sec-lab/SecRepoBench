// This function attempts to extract a literal string from a regular expression
// Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It first checks if the root node of the AST is
// either a single literal or a concatenation of literals. If the regex consists
// solely of literals, it calculates the total length of the string. If any node
// in the AST is not a literal, it returns NULL, indicating that the regex is not
// a simple literal. If a literal string is found, it allocates memory for a
// SIZED_STRING structure and populates it with the extracted literal string,
// which is then returned. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory.
