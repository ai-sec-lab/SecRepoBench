// Handle packets with operation codes 0x07 and 0x08, which correspond to
// "Open Connection Request 2" and "Open Connection Reply 2". For each case,
// determine the IP address offset using the raknet_dissect_ip function. Verify
// the correctness of the payload length against expected values and that the
// IP address offset is valid. Extract the MTU size from the packet and check if
// it exceeds the maximum supported value of 1500. If any validation fails,
// exclude the protocol; otherwise, continue processing.
