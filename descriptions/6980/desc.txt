// Parse an expression enclosed in square brackets to extract a subexpression.
// Evaluate the extracted subexpression to obtain a value which is then used
// to update the index `i`. Increment the pointer `p` to advance past the closing
// bracket. If the next character is a period, increment `p` once more.
