// Validate the DNS query to ensure it has a valid number of queries and conforms to
// specific flags for dynamic DNS updates or contains no answers and authority records.
// If valid, parse the DNS query to extract the query type by traversing the payload until
// a null terminator is found. Update the flow structure with the extracted query type.
// Return an error code if the query is invalid.
