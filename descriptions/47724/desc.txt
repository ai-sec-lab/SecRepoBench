// Check each HTTP header line in the packet to determine if it matches any
// predefined suspicious header keys for specific starting letters. If a
// suspicious header is found, format a string indicating which header was
// detected and set the risk level for the flow accordingly. The process
// iterates over several cases based on the initial character of the header
// line ('A', 'C', 'M', 'O', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'X'), performing the same
// check and risk-setting action for each applicable case.
