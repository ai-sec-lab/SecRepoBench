// Check if the filename in the Content-Disposition line is enclosed in quotes.
// Allocate memory for the filename and copy it from the header, adjusting 
// the length if necessary based on whether the final character is a quote.
// Handle different cases where the filename could be wrapped with quotes 
// or not, and ensure proper null termination of the copied string.
