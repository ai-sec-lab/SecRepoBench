// Unpacks a binary string into a string of '0' and '1' characters based on the provided bit length.
// If bit length is -1 or exceeds the number of available bits in the source, it defaults to the maximum bit length.
// Handles both LSB (Least Significant Bit) and non-LSB packing flags to determine bit order.
// Creates a new string with '0' or '1' depending on the bit value and adds it to the result array.
// Returns the number of bytes processed from the source.
