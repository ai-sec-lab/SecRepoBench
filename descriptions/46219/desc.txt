// This code block handles retrieving and processing ICC profile properties from an image. 
// It attempts to retrieve ICC profile data and parses it to extract various details such as 
// description, manufacturer, model, and copyright information. 
// The properties are retrieved using the Little CMS (LCMS) library if available, and 
// these details are then stored as image properties. 
// The function also manages different branches depending on the LCMS version and ensures 
// proper memory management through the use of StringInfo objects. 
// If the profile is valid and processed successfully, relevant properties are set; 
// otherwise, appropriate return values indicate failure to retrieve valid ICC profile data.
