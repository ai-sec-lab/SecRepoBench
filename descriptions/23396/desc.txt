// Check for a double CR+NL ("\r\n\r\n") sequence in the payload, indicating the end of HTTP headers and the beginning of the body.
// If found, calculate the length of the remaining payload after the headers, and copy a portion of this data into
// `flow->initial_binary_bytes`, up to the size of `initial_binary_bytes`. Update `flow->initial_binary_bytes_len` with the actual
// number of bytes copied. This process allows storing the initial part of the HTTP body for further analysis or inspection.
