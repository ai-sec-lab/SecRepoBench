// Calculate the width of the image section that needs to be processed in the
// current row. The width is determined by taking the minimum of the image
// frame width (`frame.w`) and the width of the raw image section that can be
// decoded given the number of components per pixel (`N_COMP`) and the
// color planes per pixel in the raw image (`mRaw->getCpp()`).
