// The part handles the decompression of data using zlib's inflate function.
// It processes the input buffer while dynamically resizing the output buffer to accommodate
// the decompressed data. The loop continues inflating data until the end of the input is reached
// or an error occurs. If an error occurs, the error code is set to indicate a non-compliant bitstream.
// The output buffer size is doubled each time it fills up, ensuring enough space for decompressed data.
// After the decompression loop, the total output size is calculated, and the inflate stream is cleaned up.
// Finally, a null character is appended to the decompressed data to ensure it is properly terminated.
