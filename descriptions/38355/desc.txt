// Perform additional sanitization on the subtables if they are of a specific type.
// Check if the subtables are of the 'Extension' type and ensure that all subtables
// have the same type, which should not be the 'Extension' type itself. This verification
// is done only if no edits have been made during the sanitization process, to ensure
// that subsequent edits do not invalidate previously checked subtables. If any subtable
// type is inconsistent, return false to indicate unsuccessful sanitization. Otherwise,
// return true if all checks pass.
