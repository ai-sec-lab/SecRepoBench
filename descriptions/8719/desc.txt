// Log the type and length of the current MNG chunk being read if logging is enabled.
// Check if the chunk's length is valid, ensuring it does not exceed maximum allowed
// size or the size of the image blob, and verify if the count is sufficient to read
// the chunk type. If any condition fails, handle the error by throwing a reader
// exception for a corrupt image. Initialize pointers `p` and `chunk` to NULL
// to prepare for further processing.
