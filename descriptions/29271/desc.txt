// Initialize an SplObjectStorage object and prepare for unserialization.
// Parse function parameters to retrieve the serialized buffer and its length.
// If the buffer is empty or parameter parsing fails, the function returns early.
// Initialize variables for unserialization, including the storage, buffer pointers,
// and data for unserialization.
// Begin by verifying the serialized data format, ensuring it starts with specific
// characters and retrieving the count of elements to unserialize.
// For each element in the serialized data, verify the format and unserialize the
// object entry and additional information if present.
// Ensure the unserialized entry is an object, calculate a hash for the object,
// and attempt to retrieve any existing element with the same hash in the storage.
// If an element exists, manage resources for its associated data.
// Attach the unserialized object and its info to the storage, replacing any existing
// entry data with the new one. Handle resource management and cleanup for unserialized data.
