// The function `flb_gzip_compress` compresses the input buffer using the GZip format.
// It initializes the zlib stream for compression and manually constructs a GZip header,
// deflates the data, and calculates a CRC32 checksum for the compressed data. 
// The function allocates a buffer for the compressed output, handles the compression 
// process with a loop to ensure all input data is processed, and appends the CRC32 and 
// original data length as the footer. The compressed data along with its length is returned 
// to the caller via the `out_data` and `out_len` pointers. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
