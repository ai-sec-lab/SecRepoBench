// If any constructor arguments are other constructors with multiple components, flatten those
// constructors into the parent constructor. For example, float4(float2(1, 2), 3, 4) should become
// float4(1, 2, 3, 4). Walk through the arguments, identify those that can be flattened, and
// rebuild the constructor with the flattened components. After flattening, replace the original
// expression with the optimized one in the CFG and mark that a rescan might be needed.
