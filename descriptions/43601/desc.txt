// This function reads a tag from an ICC profile, identified by the given signature,
// and returns a pointer to the read data. It first checks if the data is already
// loaded in memory; if so, it returns the cached pointer. If not, it reads the data
// from the profile file at the specified offset and size. The function uses the 
// appropriate tag descriptor and type handler for processing. It also handles 
// errors such as unsupported tag types, raw tags read requests, and inconsistencies 
// in the number of elements. If an error occurs during the process, the function 
// returns NULL.
