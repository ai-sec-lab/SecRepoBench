// This part implements a function to decompress and extract a specific number of items
// from a compressed data chunk. The function performs the following tasks:
// 1. Validates the input parameters, including ensuring that the requested range of items is
//    within the bounds of the compressed data.
// 2. Iterates over the blocks in the compressed chunk, determining the relevant portion for
//    the requested items, and performs decompression when necessary.
// 3. Utilizes a temporary buffer for decompression, unless the data can be directly copied
//    into the destination buffer.
// 4. Handles special value cases efficiently by using specialized functions for setting values
//    like NaNs, zeros, or repeated values.
// 5. Adjusts temporary buffer sizes dynamically, ensuring that the decompression process can
//    handle varying block sizes.
// 6. Returns the number of uncompressed bytes, or an error code if any issues arise during
//    the extraction process.
