// Initialize necessary variables and check input constraints, such as ensuring
// the number of items to extract is non-zero and within destination buffer size limits.
// Calculate the stop index based on the start index and the number of items.
// Set up the starting position for block indices and verify that the specified
// region is within valid bounds of the source data. Determine whether the data
// is memcpyed or contains special values, and handle these cases accordingly.
// If special handling is required for certain types, perform operations such as
// setting special values or handling memory copying directly to the destination.
