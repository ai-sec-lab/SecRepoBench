// This code block implements the process of decoding a block of coefficients
// using variable length coding (VLC) in the Mimic codec. The function retrieves
// VLC codes from the bitstream using the `get_vlc2` function, which provides
// the next VLC code and the number of bits to read. The VLC code contains the
// position increment (`pos_add`) and the number of bits (`num_bits`) for the 
// next value. The code checks for end-of-block and error conditions, then reads
// the value using `get_bits`. It uses a lookup table (`vlcdec_lookup`) to 
// translate the value into a coefficient, which is scaled and adjusted before 
// being stored in the DCT block using a scan table permutation. The calculation
// incorporates adjustments to match the behavior of FFmpeg's IDCT.
