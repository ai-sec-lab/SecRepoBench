// Check if the current character in 'strip' matches the corresponding character
// in 'cond'. If 'cond' specifies a character class (enclosed in brackets),
// determine if the 'strip' character is within this class. If the class is
// negated (indicated by '^'), ensure the 'strip' character is not within it.
// Print warnings or errors if the characters or conditions are incompatible,
// and handle any syntax issues with the condition, such as missing brackets.
