// This function, `flb_parser_json_do`, processes a JSON input buffer and
// converts it into a MessagePack format. It initializes required variables
// and buffers, then calls `flb_pack_json_recs` to perform the conversion.
// If the conversion is successful and results in a single record, the
// function checks if the MessagePack object is a map. If there are any
// decoders set in the parser, they are applied to the MessagePack buffer.
// The function resolves the timestamp using a specified time key and time 
// format from the parser, handling the time conversion accordingly. If the 
// time key is found, the function updates the output buffer to exclude this
// key if configured not to keep it. The final output buffer and size are set,
// and the resolved time is stored in the `out_time` structure before returning
// the size of the output buffer.
