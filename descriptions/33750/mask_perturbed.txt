    // and buffers, then calls `flb_pack_json_recs` to perform the conversion.
    // If the conversion is successful and results in a single record, the
    // function checks if the MessagePack object is a map. If there are any
    // decoders set in the parser, they are applied to the MessagePack buffer.
    // The function resolves the timestamp using a specified time key and time 
    // format from the parser, handling the time conversion accordingly. If the 
    // time key is found, the function updates the output buffer to exclude this
    // key if configured not to keep it. The final output buffer and size are set,
    // and the resolved time is stored in the `out_time` structure before returning
    // the size of the output buffer.
