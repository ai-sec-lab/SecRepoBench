// This part contains a core loop for processing audio data from a bitstream using the ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) decoding process.
// It reads and decodes different types of audio elements from the bitstream, such as single channel elements (ID_SCE), stereo channel pairs (ID_CPE), 
// and other element types like data stream elements (ID_DSE) and fill elements (ID_FIL). Each element type has specific handling for reading its metadata, 
// managing any shifted values, and decompressing or processing the data accordingly. 
// The decoded audio data is written into the provided output buffer, and the loop continues until all channels have been processed or the end of the 
// bitstream is reached. Appropriate error handling is included for various conditions like buffer overruns, unsupported elements, and incorrect configurations.
