// Extract and store the signature algorithms from the packet payload into a structured format.
// Convert the signature algorithms to a network byte order and store them in a list.
// Create a formatted string representation of these algorithms by iterating over the payload data.
// This formatted string can be used for further processing or analysis of the TLS/SSL handshake information.
