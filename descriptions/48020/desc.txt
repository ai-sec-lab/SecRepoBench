// Handle protocol-specific information extraction for SSH and TLS (including QUIC) protocols.
// For SSH, retrieve client and server signatures, and hash values associated with the connection.
// For TLS or QUIC protocols, extract various details such as SSL version, server names,
// JA3 client/server fingerprints, cipher details, and certificate information.
// Additionally, handle ALPN and supported versions for TLS/QUIC, and update flow information
// accordingly. If DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS) detection is enabled,
// adjust the payload length tracking.
// This code block integrates with the rest of the function by providing specialized
// handling for different protocols, updating the flow's fields with extracted protocol data.
