// Parses a JSON object by iterating through its fields. The function first
// skips any leading whitespace and checks for an opening quote to ensure 
// the start of a string key. It parses the string and expects a colon to 
// separate the key and the value. It then recursively parses the value, 
// which could be any valid JSON type. It continues parsing fields, 
// expecting either a comma to separate fields or a closing brace to end 
// the object. If parsing is successful, it updates the pointer position 
// and returns a success flag. The function also includes debugging output 
// to trace parsing steps and errors.
