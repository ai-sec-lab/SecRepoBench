// Determine the message length and offset based on the first byte of the payload.
// Calculate the expected total packet length by adding a specific value to the
// message length. If the calculated total length matches the actual packet length,
// the function identifies the packet as a CAPWAP connection and proceeds to add it
// using ndpi_int_capwap_add_connection. Otherwise, it excludes the protocol from
// further detection processing.
