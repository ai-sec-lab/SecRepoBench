// After identifying a valid compound word, ensure that the compound word
// does not contain repeated or forbidden patterns. First, verify if the
// original word has compound replacement issues using cpdrep_check. Then,
// check if the first part of the compound word matches with the current
// segment of the word being analyzed. Temporarily modify the word to
// exclude the processed segment and validate it for repetition and word
// pair issues. If a forbidden word exists, perform a lookup to confirm
// that the identified segment does not form a forbidden word. Restore
// the modified segment of the word after these checks.
