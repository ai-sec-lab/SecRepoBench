// This function handles adding a single fragment to a reassembly table for
// packets that use a single sequence numbering scheme. It begins by checking
// if the current frame has already been processed and stored in the reassembly
// table, returning the completed reassembly if it has. If not, it tries to
// find the correct position in the reassembly sequence to add the new fragment,
// considering the fragment's sequence number, whether it's the first or last
// fragment, and the reassembly's maximum allowed fragments and age limit.
// If the fragment completes the reassembly, the function updates the reassembly
// table, removes in-progress entries, and returns the reassembled packet.
