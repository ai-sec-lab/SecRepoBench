// Process the TLS handshake to extract JA3 and JA3S fingerprints for both
// Client Hello and Server Hello messages within a flow. For Server Hello,
// update the SSL version and extract cipher suite and TLS extensions,
// then compute a JA3S hash from this information and store it in the flow
// data structure. For Client Hello, extract cipher suites, TLS extensions,
// elliptic curves, and elliptic curve point formats, compute a JA3 fingerprint
// hash, and store it. Additionally, handle special extensions such as
// server name indication, supported groups, elliptic curve formats,
// ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation), and supported versions.
// This enables identification and analysis of the TLS protocol versions
// and features used in the handshake by generating unique fingerprints
// for further security or analytics purposes.
