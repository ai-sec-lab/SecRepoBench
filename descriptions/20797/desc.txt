// This part handles the processing of TLS Client and Server Hello messages
// for a flow. It decodes the handshake type and extracts relevant information
// like cipher suites, extensions, elliptic curves, and more. It constructs a JA3
// fingerprint string from these elements and computes its MD5 hash. For Server
// Hello, it also identifies the SSL version and verifies the safety of the cipher.
// The computed JA3 and JA3S hashes help in identifying client and server
// characteristics.
