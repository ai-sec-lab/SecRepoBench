// Parse face definitions from the buffer to construct the mesh faces. For each 
// face, read a line from the buffer and parse the number of indices that the 
// face consists of. If the number of indices is zero or greater than a 
// reasonable limit (e.g., 9), log an error and skip the face. For valid faces, 
// allocate memory for the face indices and parse each index. If an index is 
// out of range, log an error and clamp it to the maximum valid vertex index. 
// Increment face and vertex counters appropriately.
