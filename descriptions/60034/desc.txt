// Prevent an infinite loop that occurs under certain conditions
// involving `scpd`, `onlycpdrule`, and `simplifiedcpd`. If the loop
// is detected to continue indefinitely, issue a warning and break
// out of the loop. Additionally, adjust `cmin` and `cmax` to their
// original values if specified conditions are met during the loop.
