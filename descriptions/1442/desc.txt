// This function decodes an AAC frame using the FDK-AAC library. It first
// fills the AAC decoder with input data from the AVPacket. If the filling
// is successful, it attempts to decode the frame and store the output in
// a buffer. The function checks for errors after each step, logging any
// issues and returning appropriate error codes. If decoding is successful,
// it retrieves stream information such as the number of samples and channel
// layout, then prepares an AVFrame with the decoded audio data, copying it
// from the decoder buffer. It sets the 'has_decoded_frame' flag to indicate
// that a frame has been successfully decoded and returns the number of bytes
// consumed from the input packet.
