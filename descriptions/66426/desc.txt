// This function implements a substring search using a technique called 
// SWAR (SIMD Within A Register), which allows for efficient string 
// searching by leveraging bitwise operations. It uses different bit 
// masks for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures to handle character 
// comparisons. The function iterates through the target string in 
// chunks of size `sizeof(bitint)` and checks for potential matches 
// using bitwise operations. If a match is found, it is verified 
// using `memcmp` to ensure the substring actually matches. If no 
// match is found, the function returns -1.
