// This function performs a memory search using a SWAR (SIMD within a register)
// technique to locate a needle (substring) within a haystack (main string).
// It uses bit manipulation to quickly find potential matches and then verifies
// them with a traditional memcmp for accuracy. The algorithm defines bit masks
// for efficient search based on system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
// It iterates over the haystack in chunks of the size of `bitint`, checking
// for equal first and last characters of the needle. If potential matches are
// found, it uses memcmp to confirm a full match. The function handles endianness
// and adjusts the search process accordingly.
