// Check if the 'entry' pointer is NULL and handle the error if it is.
// Populate the 'entry' value based on its type by converting the string
// value from 'kv->val' to the appropriate type (e.g., string, integer,
// double, size, time, boolean). If the type is a list, parse the string
// into a list and validate the number of entries. Handle errors such as
// invalid boolean values or list parsing failures, and ensure that
// resources are managed correctly by registering the entry even in
// error cases to facilitate cleanup.
