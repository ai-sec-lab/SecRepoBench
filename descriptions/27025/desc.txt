// Create a new configuration map value entry and populate it based on the type.
// Allocate memory for the new entry, checking for allocation errors. 
// Depending on the type of configuration (string, integer, double, size, time, boolean, or list),
// parse and store the value accordingly. For boolean and list types, perform extra validation.
// If the value is a list, parse it into a list data structure and check the list size meets expectations.
// Add the newly created entry to the map's 'mult' list tail and update the user context with it.
