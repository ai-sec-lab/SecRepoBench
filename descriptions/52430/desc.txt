// Verify if the second word in a compound is valid by checking several conditions:
// - Ensure the word has the appropriate flags (compoundflag or compoundend).
// - Check if the compound does not exceed maximum allowed words or syllables.
// - Validate against compound patterns to ensure it does not match any forbidden patterns.
// - Ensure the compound does not contain duplicate parts unless allowed by checkcompounddup.
// If all conditions are met, the compound is considered valid, and further processing can continue.
