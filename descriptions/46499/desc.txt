// Parse the packet payload to ensure it contains the expected sequence of numeric and alphanumeric
// characters. Update the `tinc_state` of the flow if the format is correct. If the end of the sequence
// is reached and the `tinc_state` exceeds 3, initialize the Tinc cache if it doesn't exist, and add
// the current flow's cache entry to it. Log the detection of a Tinc TCP connection and update the
// detected protocol for the flow. If the sequence is invalid at any point, exit the loop without making
// any changes to the flow state or cache.
