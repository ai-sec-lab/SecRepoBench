// This part processes a specific pattern in the TCP payload related to the TINC protocol.
// It first checks for a sequence of four numbers separated by spaces in the payload.
// If the sequence is found, it continues to verify that the following characters are alphanumeric
// until a newline character is reached. Upon successful matching of the pattern, the connection's
// state is advanced. If the final state is reached, a new cache is created if it doesn't exist,
// and the connection details are stored in this cache. The detected protocol is then set to TINC
// with high confidence, and a log message indicating detection of a TINC TCP connection is generated.
