// Iterate through a comma-separated list of ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) identifiers
// in the flow's data. For each identifier, check if it is not a common ALPN by using a helper function.
// If an uncommon ALPN is detected, log its presence if debugging is enabled, and record it as a risk
// in the given detection module structure. The iteration continues until the end of the ALPN list is reached.
