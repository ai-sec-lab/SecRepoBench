// Ensure that the paths `path_p` and `path_q` have sufficient memory allocation
// to accommodate additional points specified by the `pad` value. If the current
// allocation is insufficient, attempt to increase the allocated memory size by
// the required amount. If memory allocation fails, release any allocated
// resources and return `NULL` to indicate an error. This macro is used in the
// function to dynamically manage the memory required for path storage as the
// function processes the vertices of the polygon.
