// This part defines the `TraceStrokePolygon` function which generates a stroked
// polygon path based on input primitive information. It sets up the necessary 
// data structures and memory for handling the stroke calculations, including 
// line segments and paths. The function computes slopes and offsets to apply 
// line join and cap styles, and adjusts memory allocation dynamically for paths 
// as needed. It uses macros for memory management to ensure resources are 
// properly allocated and released. The resulting stroked polygon is returned as 
// an array of `PrimitiveInfo` structures, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.
