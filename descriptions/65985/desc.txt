// The code checks if a complete start code is available in the `hdr_store` buffer,
// if not, it copies additional bytes from the current packet into the `hdr_store`
// to form a complete start code. It checks for a valid start code using 
// `mpgviddmx_next_start_code` on the combined data of the buffer and new bytes.
// If no valid start code is found, it creates a new packet (`dst_pck`) with 
// the contents of `hdr_store` and sends it for further processing. 
// If a valid start code is found, it calculates the offset and sets up the 
// parser to begin parsing from the determined start code type position, 
// updating `hdr_offset` and `bytes_from_store` accordingly.
