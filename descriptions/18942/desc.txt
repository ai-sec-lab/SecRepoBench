// Handle error by cleaning up all loop variable identifiers and resetting
// loop depth to zero, ensuring no remaining state from previous loops
// when an error occurs during parsing. Initialize loop state by setting
// up a variable frame for local variables associated with the loop. This
// involves preparing internal variables for the loop's execution, which
// are accessed relative to the variable frame. If the loop nesting limit
// is exceeded, an error is triggered.
