// Iterate over the tags in the crypto data to identify specific tags, "SNI\0" and "UAID".
// For the "SNI\0" tag, extract the server name indication (SNI) and store it in the flow structure.
// Log the extracted SNI, match it against known subprotocols, and check for domain generation algorithm (DGA) names.
// Mark the hello message as processed to allow for custom category matching.
// For the "UAID" tag, extract the User-Agent ID and process it using an external function.
// Ensure that SNI and UAID are processed correctly without exceeding the bounds of the crypto data.
// If both SNI and UAID are found, terminate the function early.
