// Determine the transport protocol of the packet (TCP or UDP) and perform
// checks based on the protocol to validate the packet's payload length
// and UDP header structure. If the packet's protocol is neither TCP nor
// UDP, or the checks fail, exclude the protocol from further processing
// for this flow. Otherwise, adjust the payload offset and length if needed
// and set a pointer to store the number of matches found in the flow
// structure for either TCP or UDP. Log the start of the memcached search
// process.
