// Initialize pointers for the word and its description to point to the input strings.
// If the input word contains ignored characters or complex prefixes are enabled,
// create copies of the input word and description (if applicable). Remove ignored characters
// from the word copy if necessary, and reverse the word and description copies if complex
// prefixes are enabled. Update the pointers to point to the modified word and description
// copies. Additionally, ensure any necessary checks or operations are performed on the affix
// length to maintain functionality as expected by the rest of the function.
