// This function compares the absolute values of two multi-precision integers
// represented by the `mpz_t` structures `y` and `second_operand`.
// It returns -1 if `y` is less than `second_operand`, 1 if `y` is greater,
// and 0 if they are equal. The comparison is performed by iterating over the
// limbs from the most significant to the least significant.
