// Extract a segment of the payload starting from the current position in the packet,
// up to a maximum size that fits into the initial_binary_bytes buffer of the flow.
// Store the length of the copied bytes in initial_binary_bytes_len.
// This operation is performed after detecting a specific pattern in the payload
// and prepares the extracted segment for further analysis or inspection.
