// Determine the literal length from the token and adjust the length if it exceeds a certain threshold.
// If the length is equal to a predefined maximum short literal length, read additional bytes from
// the literals pointer to compute the final length. Increment the literals pointer accordingly based
// on the number of bytes read. Update the length by adding the maximum short literal length, resulting
// in the total literal length. This process enables the function to correctly handle both short and
// extended literal sequences in the input data stream during decompression.
