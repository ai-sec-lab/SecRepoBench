// This code block implements the reading of TIFF images using different methods
// based on the TIFF image structure and compression type. The methods include:
// 1. ReadYCCKMethod: Converts YCCK TIFF images by reading pixel data, applying
//    color transformations, and storing them in the image object.
// 2. ReadStripMethod: Handles TIFF images stored as strips. It reads pixel data
//    strip by strip, supporting multi-sample images with interlace considerations.
// 3. ReadTileMethod: Manages TIFF images stored as tiles. It reads pixel data
//    tile by tile, ensuring proper alignment and color channel processing.
// 4. ReadGenericMethod: Utilizes TIFF's built-in RGBA reader to handle generic
//    TIFF images. It processes the pixel data from top to bottom, ensuring
//    compatibility with different color channels and updating image progress.
