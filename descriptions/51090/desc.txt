// Parse key-value pairs from a URL encoded form in the given buffer.
// For each key-value pair, a subtree is added to the protocol tree.
// The key and value are extracted using the 'get_form_key_value' function,
// with the key-value separator '=' and pair separator '&'.
// The extracted key and value are decoded to UTF-8, stored in the protocol
// tree, and formatted for display.
// The offset in the buffer is updated accordingly after each key-value pair.
