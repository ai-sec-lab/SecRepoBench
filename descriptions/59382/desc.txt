//
// Function to uncompress data using DwaCompressor. It first extracts and
// validates header information, including various sizes and compression
// types. It initializes necessary buffers and sets up pointers for the
// compressed data sections (UNKNOWN, AC, DC, RLE). Each data section is
// then decompressed into its respective buffer. After decompression, the
// data is processed according to its compression scheme (LOSSY_DCT, RLE,
// UNKNOWN) and stored in the output buffer. The function handles multiple
// channels and considers channel sets that need to be processed together.
// It performs various checks for data integrity and returns an error if
// any corruption is detected during the process.
