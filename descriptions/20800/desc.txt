// Extract the PDB file path from the CodeView debug information if present.
// Check the CodeView header signature to determine the version (PDB20 or PDB70).
// Depending on the signature, cast the header to the appropriate structure.
// If the structure fits within the PE data, retrieve the PDB file path.
// Calculate the length of the PDB path ensuring it does not exceed MAX_PATH.
// If the path is valid, store it in the PE object as a sized string.
