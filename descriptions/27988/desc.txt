// Release the memory allocated for various protocol-specific buffers associated
// with the flow object, if they are not already freed. This includes freeing
// buffers related to HTTP data, Kerberos packets, and if applicable, buffers
// related to TLS/SSL or QUIC protocols. This ensures that all dynamically
// allocated resources tied to the flow are properly deallocated before the
// flow itself is freed.
