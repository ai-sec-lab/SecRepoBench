// Calculate the number of points required for rendering different primitive types such as PathPrimitive, CirclePrimitive, ArcPrimitive, and EllipsePrimitive.
// For PathPrimitive, parse the token to determine the count of points, and scale the count to estimate the points extent needed.
// For CirclePrimitive and ArcPrimitive, compute the radius and use geometric calculations to estimate the required points extent, with a check for excessive coordinates.
// For EllipsePrimitive, use a dedicated function to determine the required points extent based on the ellipse's properties.
// The calculated points_extent helps in ensuring sufficient memory allocation for rendering the primitives.
