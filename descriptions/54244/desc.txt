// Check if the first word of a compound is valid based on several conditions.
// - Validate using compound flags and patterns, taking into account language-specific rules (e.g., Hungarian).
// - Consider special patterns and rules such as compound triple letter check, case sensitivity, and required affixes.
// - If the first word is valid, recursively check the next word(s) in the compound.
// - If the second word is a valid root or can be a word with prefixes/suffixes, return success.
// - Ensure that combinations adhere to conditions such as syllable count, maximum compound words, and allowed patterns.
// - Handle specific conditions for compound words, such as preventing common errors and checking for forbidden words.
// - Implement recursive checks for compound words to ensure complete validation.
