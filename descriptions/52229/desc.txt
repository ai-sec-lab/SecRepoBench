// Extracts version numbers from HTTP server strings for Apache or nginx,
// formats them into integers, and compares them against predefined minimum
// version values. If the server version is below the minimum, it logs a
// message indicating the server is obsolete. The code iterates over the 
// version string, constructs a buffer to hold the version components, and 
// uses sscanf to parse them into integers. The check is performed based on 
// the format of the server string, which distinguishes between Apache 
// and nginx by the offset in the server string.
