// Extract the version number from the server string for either Apache or nginx
// by iterating over the characters following the server name. Convert the version
// string to three separate numerical components (major, minor, patch). Calculate
// a single version value by combining these components. Compare the extracted
// version against predefined minimum versions for Apache and nginx. If the server
// version is lower than the respective minimum version, set a risk on the flow
// indicating an obsolete server version, along with a descriptive message.
