// Parse IRC messages to detect commands like SEND, CHAT, sslchat, and TSEND.
// Upon detection, extract a port number from the message and store it in the source or
// destination ID structures if not already present and within allowed limits.
// Update the timestamp of the last detected activity for the relevant structure.
// This helps in tracking the IRC activity based on specific port usage.
