// Iterate through the 'flags' string to identify comma-separated decimal numbers,
// converting each segment into an unsigned short integer. Store each parsed flag
// into the 'result' array. If a flag value is out of the acceptable range, log
// a warning and store a default value of 0. Update the source pointer to the next
// segment after each comma, and advance the destination pointer to store subsequent flags.
