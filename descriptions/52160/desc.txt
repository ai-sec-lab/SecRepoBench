// Extracts the server version number from the server name string and compares 
// it to minimum version numbers for Apache and Nginx. The function iterates 
// through the server string starting from an offset to find the version number.
// It parses the version number using sscanf to extract major, minor, and patch 
// numbers, combines them into a single numeric value, and then compares this 
// value against pre-defined constants for the minimum version numbers. If the 
// version is found to be below the required minimum for either Apache or Nginx, 
// it sets a risk flag with a message indicating that an obsolete server version 
// has been detected.
