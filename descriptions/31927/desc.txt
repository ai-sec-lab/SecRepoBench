// Iterates over the samples in a track to read sample sizes based on compact or regular table.
// For each sample, reads the size and updates the total size, max size, and total samples count.
// Handles cases where sample sizes are stored as either 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, or default size.
// If the table uses 4-bit sizes, processes two samples at a time and manages zero-padding for odd counts.
