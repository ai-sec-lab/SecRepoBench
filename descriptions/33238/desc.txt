// Iterate through the string `in` to clean up path delimiters
            // and handle special cases. Paths starting with "://" or "\\" 
            // are left untouched. For paths containing double delimiters 
            // (e.g., "//" or "\\\\"), convert all delimiters to the OS 
            // specific separator and remove any duplicates. Additionally, 
            // the code attempts to decode URI-style hex sequences (e.g., 
            // "%20") by converting them to their ASCII equivalent if valid.
