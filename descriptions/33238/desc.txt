// This function cleans up the given file path string. It removes any leading spaces
        // and normalizes path separators to the operating system's standard. It also handles
        // potential issues such as double path delimiters and improperly formatted paths.
        // Additionally, it processes hex-encoded sequences in URIs and replaces them with
        // their corresponding characters.
