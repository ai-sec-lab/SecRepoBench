// Function to trace a stroked polygon with respect to line cap and join attributes.
// It computes the stroke paths by creating offset paths from the original vertices,
// considering the specified line join and cap styles.
// Handles different join styles (bevel, miter, round) and cap styles (butt, round, square).
// Allocates memory for stroke paths and resizes if necessary to accommodate the required number of points.
// The function returns a pointer to a PrimitiveInfo structure containing the stroke path.
