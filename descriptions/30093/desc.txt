// Convert the value obtained from the key lookup to its string representation
// based on its type. For integer values, format the value as a string and
// append it to the buffer. For float values, convert the float to a string
// and append it. For string values, append the string directly to the buffer.
// If the value is null, append the string "null" to the buffer. This process
// supports appending various data types to the buffer as strings for further
// processing or output.
