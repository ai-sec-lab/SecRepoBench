// If a "USER " pattern is found in the IRC payload, extract the username.
// The username is stored in a buffer.
// A space character in the username is replaced with a null character
// to terminate the string at the first occurrence of a space.
// A message is then formatted with the extracted username and logged
// with a risk indication of clear text credentials.
