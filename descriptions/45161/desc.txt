// Iterate over metadata tables indicated by set bits in the Valid mask of the Tilde header.
// For each table, ensure the number of rows is reasonable and the table data fits within the 
// bounds of the Portable Executable (PE) file. Parse each table based on its type and 
// dynamically adjust the parsing logic for tables with variable-sized columns as specified in 
// ECMA-335 II.22. For each table of interest, such as BIT_MODULE or BIT_TYPEREF, extract relevant 
// data like strings, assembly references, or resources, and store them in the appropriate fields 
// in the module's YR_OBJECT. Skipped tables are advanced by their calculated size to continue 
// parsing subsequent tables.
