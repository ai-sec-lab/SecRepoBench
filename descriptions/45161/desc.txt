// Retrieve the number of rows for the current table being processed from the
// row_offset array, adjusting for endianness. Ensure that the number of rows
// does not exceed a predefined threshold to avoid unreasonable or malformed
// values. Validate that the table_offset pointer is within the bounds of the
// PE file, ensuring that further processing of the table data is safe.
