// This code block is a function to parse a JSON constant (such as "true", "false", or "null") 
// from a given JSON string. It takes a pointer to the current position in the string, the end 
// of the string, the constant string to match, and its length as arguments. The function checks 
// if the specified constant string matches the content at the current position in the JSON 
// string. If all characters match, it updates the pointer to the current position to reflect 
// the parsed constant and returns 1 (indicating success). If a mismatch occurs, it returns 0 
// (indicating failure). Debugging information is printed using the DPRINTF macro to track 
// parsing progress and results.
