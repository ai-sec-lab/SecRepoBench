// Handle the execution flow for different function types (e.g., 'while', 'do', 'for', 'if')
// by managing indexing for addressing elements in the stack. Depending on the function type
// and the number of arguments found (tracked by FndArgs), update the indices ndx1, ndx2,
// and ndx3 to manage conditional and loop control structures. Add addressing elements
// as necessary to create jumps or conditional branches in the function's execution logic.
// Specifically, manage zero-check operations and branching logic for the control structures.
