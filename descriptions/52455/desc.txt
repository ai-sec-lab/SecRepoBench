// Check if the current portion of the word (up to index i + rv->blen) forms
// a compound that matches known replacement patterns or problematic word pairs.
// If so, restore the character at position i + rv->blen to r and continue checking.
// If a forbidden word flag is set, verify if the current word is marked as forbidden
// by looking it up in the dictionary or checking its affix. If a forbidden word
// is identified, return NULL to indicate an invalid compound. Otherwise, restore
// the character at position i + rv->blen to r and proceed.
