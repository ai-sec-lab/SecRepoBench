// Reuse a pre-allocated xmlNode from the context's free elements list by
// updating the free element list pointer and decrementing the counter.
// Clear the memory of the reused node and set its type to XML_ELEMENT_NODE.
// Assign the name of the node using either the provided local name or a
// newly built qualified name, based on whether dictionary-based name storage
// is used. In case of memory allocation failure for the node's name,
// report an error and exit the function.
