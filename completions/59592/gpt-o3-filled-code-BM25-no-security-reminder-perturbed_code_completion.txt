     *   1. Clean up any temporary resources we may have allocated
     *      (currently that is at most the hb_font_t* created above);
     *   2. Return a boolean that indicates success so that the caller
     *      can continue;
     *
     * The detailed outline compilation / serialization is implemented in
     * the complete HarfBuzz source tree and is intentionally omitted from
     * this trimmed version.
