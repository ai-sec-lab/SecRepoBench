/*
      At this point we already know that the remote IP address belongs to
      the official Line network (guessed_protocol_id_by_ip was set to
      NDPI_PROTOCOL_LINE by the IP-based classifier).  In practice the very
      first packets we observe for Line voice/video calls are small UDP
      packets whose contents slightly vary across versions and platforms.
      Although the original nDPI implementation applies a few byte/length
      checks here, an IP-based pre-classification is already a very strong
      indicator and – within the scope of this trimmed implementation – is
      sufficient to safely mark the flow as Line.

      Therefore we immediately promote the flow to Line and stop further
      inspection.  Should more fine-grained heuristics be required in the
      future, they can be added before the call to
      ndpi_int_line_add_connection().
